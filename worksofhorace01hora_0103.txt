ODE XIII.

² WHOEVER rais’d and planted thee,
j. Unlucky and pernicious tree,
j 'fn hour aecurs’d with impious hand
l* (Thou bane and seandal of my land)
Well may I think the pal-ridde
In blood his guilty soul had Aved,
Or plung'd his dagger in the breast,
At midnight‚ os his sleeping guest,
Or temper⁷d every baleful juice
Which poisonous Colchian glebes produce ς
, Or, is a blacker crime be known,
That crime the wretch had made his own¹
who on my harmless grounds and me
Bestow’d thee, lucldess, falling tree.

While dangers hourly round us weit„

No cantion can prevent our fate.

All other deaths the sailor dares,

Who yet the raging ocean fears ;

The Parthian views with deep dismay

The Roman chains, and firm array 3

The Roman dreads the Parthian's speed,
C* His flying war, and baekward reed:

While Deam, unheeded, sweeps away

‘she world, his everlast‘mg prey.

How near was I those dreary plains,
Where Pluto's auburn consort reigns ;
NVhere awful sits thejudge os hell ;

,’ ‘Whete piofis spirits blissful dwell ;
‘'Where Snppho's sweet complaints reprove
’ The. rivale os hez· fame and love,
