TO LICINIUS MURENA.

MCIMUS, would you live with ease,
,ffempt not too sar the faithless seas,
{nd when you hear the tempest roarf
,Press not too near th' unequal shore(
The, man, within the golden mean
who ean his boldest wish containi
Securely views tho ruin'd een,
VVhere sordid want and sorrow dwellf
And, in himselfserenely great,
Declines an envied room of state.
*When high in air the pine amends}
fo ovory ruder blast it bends.
'she pahoee falls with heavier weighss
When tumbling from its airy height ;
And when from heavon the lightning fliee‘i
Et blasts [he hius that proudest rise.
U'hoe‘er enjoys the untroubled breastl„v
th virtue's tranquil wisdom mest,
'With hope the gloomyhour can cheer5
&nd temper happineza with sear.
Π Jove the winter's horrors bring,
{et Jove restores the genia] spring.
'rhen let us not of fate complain,
for soon shall change the gloomy scene.
&pollo sometimes can inspiro
'she §ssent Muze, and. wakethe lyra τ
