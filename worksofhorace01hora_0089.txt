ODES, BOOK ΙΙ,

ΟΒΕ vu.
To POMPEIUS VARUS

' vARUS‚ from early youth belowdy
ἶ ᾼηᾶ oft with me in danger- prov’d,
¹ 'our daring host when Brutus led,
And in the cause of sreedom bled,

 

To Rome and an her guardian powers

And drunk its loitering hours away,
Profuse os sweets while Syria shed
Her liquid odours on my head ’ἒ

With thee I saw Philippi's plain,
Its fatal tout, a sem-ful scene 1
And dropp’d, alas ! th² inglorious shield,
Where valour’s sels was forc'd to yieldl.

And breath'd th' indignant soul away.
But me, when dying with my sear,

Swift did the god of wit convey ;

While thee wild war's tempestuous sea
In ebbing tides drove far from shore,

And to new scenes of slaughter bore.
Το Jove thy votive offerings paid,
ε,- Beneath my laurel's sheltering shade*
‘¹⁴ Fatigu'd with war, now rest reclin’d‚
Nor spate the easks sor thee design⁷d2
Here joyous fill the polish’d bowl„

 

What happy chance the friend restores, ·
With whom I’ve cheer'd the tedious day„

VVhere soil'd in dust the vanquish’d lag-12

Through warring hosts, inwrapp'd in ais.
