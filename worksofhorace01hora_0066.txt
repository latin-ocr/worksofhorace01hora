ODE XXIX.

ΤΟ Iccms.

ICCIUS, the blest Arabia’s gold
Can you with envious eye behold ’ἔ
Or will you boldly take the field,
And teach Sabaea's kings to yield,
, Or meditate the dreadful Mede
In chains triumphantly to lead ’.ἲ
Should ryou her hap‘less lover slay,
What captive maid shall own thy sway ·.’
What courtly youth with essenc'd hair
Shall at thy board the goblet bear,
Skilful with his great faffler's art
To wing with death the pointed dart?
Who shall deny that streams ascend.
And Tiber⁷s currents backward bend,
When you have all our hopes betray’d ;
You, that sar other promise made;
XVhen an your volumes, learned store ἒ
The treasures of Socratic lore,
Once bought at mighty price, in vain,
Arc sent ῑο purchase arms in Spain?
