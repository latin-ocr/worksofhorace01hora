:1012 THE WoRKS 01³· HORAOE

ODE XX.
To MAECENAS.

WITII strong, unwonted wing 1 riso,
A two-sorm'd poet, through the skies,
Far above envy will 1 soar,

And troad this worthless earth no more>
For know, γε rivals of my samo,
Thongh lowly born, a vulgar name,

1 will not condescend to die,

Nor in the stygian' waters lie.

A roughor sk'm now clothes my thig‘hs„

Into a swan’s fair form I rise,
And feel the seather'd'plumage‘s'hed
Its down, and o'er my shoulders spread*
Swift as with Daedalean wing,
Harmonious bird, 1⁷11 soaring sing,
And, in my ssight, the foamy shores
Where Bosphorus tremendous roars,
The regions bound by northern {cold' ,
And Lybia⁷s burning samis, behold.
Thon to the learned sons os Spain,
To him who ploughs the Scythiam main
To him who, with dissembled fears,
Conscicms. the Roman arms reverse,
To him who drinks the rapid Rhone,
Shall Horace, deathless hard Ξ be known
My friends, the sunem] sorrow sparo,
The plaintive song, and tendet tear ;
Nor let the voice of grief profane
With loud laments the solemn scene ,
'Nor o'er your poet’s empty urn
With. useless, idle sorrows mourn
