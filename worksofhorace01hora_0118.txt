lle nor the raging ocean fears,

Nor stars of power malig'n,
Whether in gloomy storms they fise,
Or swist descending through the skies

Or stars that burn the soil.

His deep foundations in the seas,

And scot-ns earth’s narrow bound ;

Contraoted by his numerous slaves,

E'ven in the vast profound.
