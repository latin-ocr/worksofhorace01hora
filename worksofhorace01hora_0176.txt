162 THE WORKS ΟΡ- HORAOR
Novice to tofis: but as the clouds refir'd,
And gentler gales provok’d a holder ssight,
On sailing Wings through? yielding air explor'd
Unwonted paths, and panted while he soar'd ὲ

Anon to ravage in the fleecy fold,
The glowing ardour of his youthful beart

Pour’d the beak’d foe ; now more maturely bo‘laez

With tallons fierce precipitant to dart
On dragous seu, reluctantia the fray3
Such is his thirst for battle, and for prey :

Or as a lion through the forest stalks,
Wean‘d by his tawny dnm from milky som} ,
Α goat deseries him from her ssow ery walks

First doom' d to stain his youthful jaws wi. L

So Drusgssolcgzk’d ῐιεῐηθηάουε to his foes,
Beneath the frozen height os Alpina snows²

The Rhoetian hands beheld him such in war >

Those daring hands, who with triumphant joa⁴

were wont to spread their baneful terrors san
Tam‘d by the conduct os the martial 1205,
felt what true courage could achieve, when led
By bright example, and by virtue bred ;
Felt how Augustus with patet-nal mind
Fir‘d the young Nemes to heroic deeds⁵

The bravo and good are copies of their kind :- '-

And raise the genius, w ondrous aid impari.
