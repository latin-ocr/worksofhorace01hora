ἑ 170 THE woRKs OF HoRACE.

ODE IX.

TO LOLLIUS.

WHILE with the Grecian bards I vie,
And raptur’d tune the social string,
Think not the song shall ever die,
Which with no vulgar art Ι sing,
Though born where Aufid rolls his sounding stream
In lands sar distant from poetic same.

What though the Muse her Homer thrones
High above au th' immortal choir,
Nor Pindar's rapture she disowns‚
Nor hides the plaintive Caean lyre :
Aleaeus strikes the tyranr's soul with dread,
Nor yet is grave Stesichorus unread.

WVhatever old Anacreon sung,
However tender was the lay,
In spite of Time is ever young,
Nor Sappho's amorous flames decay ;
Her living songs preserve their charming art,
Her love still hreathes the passibus os her heart.

Helen was not the only sair,
By an unhappy passion fir'd,

Who the lewd ringlets of the ‘hair
Of an adulterous beau admir'd ς

Com-t arte, gold lace, and equipage have charms
To tempt weak woman to a stranger’s armS.
