Not Argo thither turn⁷d her armed heud3
Medea there no magio puisun· spread ;
No merchants thither plough the pathless main,

For guilty eommerce, and a thirst of gain ;

Nor wise Ulysses, and his wandering hands,

Vicious, though brave, e'er knew these happy lands.

O'er the glad flocks no foul contagion spreads,

Nor summer sun his burning infiuence sheds.
Pure and unmix⁷d the world’s first ages roll⁷d:

But soon as brass had stain³d the flowing gold,

To iron harden'd by succeeding crimes„

Jove for thejust preserv'd these happy elimes,

To which the gods this pious race invite,

And bid me, raptur’d bard, direct their flig}1†;

ODE XVII.
To CANIDIA:

CANIDIA, to thy matchless arn
Vanquish’d I yield a suppliant heart ;- '
But oh! by HelI's extended plains,
W'here Pluto's gloomy consort reigns ;
By bright Diana’s vengeful tage,
Which prayers nor hecatombs assuage τ
And by the books, os power to call
The charmed stat-s, and bid them sall, ’
No morb‘bronounce the sacred scu-olli> -
But back the magio circle roll.
