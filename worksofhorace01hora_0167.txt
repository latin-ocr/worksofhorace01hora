ᾗ 0DES, BOOK 111. 153

om: xxm.
· 'ro MAECENAS.

DESCENDED from an ancient line,
That once the Tuscan sceptra sway'dl,
’,ἲ Haste thee to meet the generous wine,
f- . Whose piercing is for thee delay’d ;
μ’ For thee the fragrant essence flows,
·- For thee, Maeeenas, breathes the blooming rose:

From the delights, oh ! break away>
Which Tibur’s marshy prospect yields.
Nor with unceasing joy survey
Fa‘ir AEsula's declining fields
. No'more the vex-dant hills admire
Ι· Os Telegon‚ who kill’d his aged sire.

Instant forsake the joyless feast,
WVhere appetite in surfeit dies,
And from the towered structure haste,
That proudly threatens to the skies ;
From Rome and its tumultuous joys,
. l'ts orowds, and smoke, and opulence, and nojso‘.

·, where health preserving plainness dwells‚

’⁷ Nor sleeps upon the Tyrian dye,

⁴. To frugal treats, and humble cells,

⁵ With grateful change the wealthy fly.

,Α Such soenes have charm'd the pangs of cate
5‘ And smooth’d the clouded forehead of despair.

Andromeda⁷s conspicuous sire
Now darts his hidden beams from far ς
The Lion shows his maddening fite,
And barks fieroe Procy0n⁷s raging star.
Ι While Phoebus, with revolving ray,
¹ 'Brings back the hurnings of the thirsty day.
