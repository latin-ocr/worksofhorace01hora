ODES, BOOK 1. μ ’33
with poplar wreaths the hero crown’d his head,

¹ Reeking with wine, and thus his friends address’d,.

Deep sorrow brooding in each anxious breast :
Bold let us follow through the foamy tides,
XVhere Formae, better than a father, guides ;

, Avaunt, despair ἱ when Teucer calls to same,

The same your augur, and your guide the same.
Another Salamis, in foreign elime,

With rival pride shall raise her head sublime ζ
So Phoebus nods : Ye sons of valour true,
Fun often tried in deeds os deadlier hue,
To-day with wine drive every care away,
To-morrow tempt again the boundless- sea.
