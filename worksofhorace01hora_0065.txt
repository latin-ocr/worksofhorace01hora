 

ODES, BOOK 1. 57

³ 'ln hon-id pomp of war the soldier dies ;

The sailor in the greedy ocean lies ;

Thus age and youth promiscuous crowd the tomb .·

No mortal head can shun th’ impending doom.
When sets Orion's star, the wiuds thot sweep

' The raging waves, o'erwhelm'd me in the deep :

ἰ Νοι· thou, my friend, refuse with impious hand

: A little portion of this wandering sand

“ To these my poor remains; so may the storm

Rage o’er the woods, nor ocean's face deform:

May gracious Jove with wealth thy toile repay,

And Neptune guard thee through the watery way ἶ
Thy guiltless rece this bold neglect shall mourn„

And thou shalt feel the just returns of scorn.

My curses shall pursue the guilty deed,

And all· m vain thy richest victims bleed.

Whate’ er thy haste, oh' let my prayer prevass,

Thrice estrow the saud, then hoi stthe flyings aii
