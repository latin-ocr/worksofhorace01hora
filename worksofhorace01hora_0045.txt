ODES, BOOK 1.

ΗῩΜΝ 'ro MERCURY.

1 SING the god, whose arts refin’d
The savage race os human kind,
By eloquence their pas÷ions charm'd7
By exercise their bodies form⁷d :
Han, winged messenger of Jove
And all th' immor-tal powers above,
Sweet parent of the bending lyre,
Thy praise shall all its sounds inspiro.
Artful and cunning ro conceal
XVhaVor in sportive theft you steal,
When from the god who gilds the pole',
Even yet a boy, his herds you stole,
With angry voice the threat⁷ning power
Bad thee the fraudful prey restore ;
But of his quiver too beguil⁷d,

Pleas-’d with the thest Appollo smil’d.
You were the wealthy Priam's guide
WVhen sase from Agamemnon’s pride,
Through hostile campS‚ which round him spread
Their watchful fires, his way he sped.
Unspotted spirits you consign
To blissful seats and joys divine,
And powerful with your golden wand
The light, unbodied crowd command :
Thus grateful does your office prove
To gods below, and gods above.
