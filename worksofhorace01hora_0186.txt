172 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Villains, in public rapine bold,
Lollius, the just avenger, dread,
Who never by the charms of gold,
Shining seducet, was misled ε
Beyond thy year such virtue shall extend,
And death alone thy consulate shall end.

Perpetua} magistrate is he,
W ho keeps striet Justice full m sight2
W ith scorn rejects th' offender⁷ s see,
Nor weighs convenience against right:
who bids the crowd at awful distance gaze,

And V irtue's arms victoriously displays.

Not he, of wealth immense possest‚
Tasteless who piles his massy gold,
Among the number of the blest
Should have his glorious name enroll'd ς
He better claime the glorious name, who knows
With wisdom to enjoy what heaven bestowsae

who knows the wrongs os want to bear,
Even in its lowest, last extreme
Yet can with conscious virtue sear,
Far worse than death, a deed of shame;
Undaunted, for his country or his friend,
‘1¹0 sam-ifice his life—0 glor-icus end ἓ
