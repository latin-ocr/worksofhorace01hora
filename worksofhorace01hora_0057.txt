(Should great Maecenas be my guest&
1 Crude vintage of the Sabine grape, -

4. But yet in sober eups, shall crown the seam t

K *Twas raek'd into a Grecian cask,
Its rougher juiee to melt away :
Ι seaJ⁷d it too—a pleasing task !

With annual joy to mark the glorious dap-2

When in applausive shouts thyrname
spread from the theatre around,
Floating on thy own Tiber's stream,

And Echo, playful nymph, return'd the soum}

From the Caecubian vintage ptest
For you shall flow the racy wine t
But ah ! my meagre cup's unblest
With the rich Formiau or Falernian vine
