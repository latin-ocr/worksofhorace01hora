’ 'ro VARUS.

, ROUND Catilus' walls, or in Tibur’s rich soil,

, To plant the glad vine be my Varus' first toil ;

For God hath propos’d to the wretch who’s athirst

ζ To drink, or with beart-gnawing cares to be curst

of war, or of want, who e'er pratas o’er his wine ῖ

For 'tis thine, father Bacchus; bright Venus, 'tis
thine, ·

To charm all his careS. Yet that no one may pas.-

The sreedom and mirth of a temperate glass‚

Let us think on the Lapithae⁷s quarrels so dire,

And the Thracians, whom wine can to madness iu-
spire ε

Insatiate os liquor when glow their full veins,

No distinction of vice or of virtue remains.

Grqat god of the vine‚who dost candour approve.

Ι ne'er will thy statues profanely remove;

1 ne'er will thy riteS, so mysterious. betray

To the broad-glaring eye of the taRe-telling day.

Oh! stop the loud cymbal‚ the cornet's alanus,

XVhose sound, when the Bacchanal‘s bozon] it
warms,

{- Arouses sels-love, by blindness misled,

And vansty, lifting alost the light head.

And honour, of prodigal spirit, that shows,

Transparent as g1ass, all tho secrets it know-s.
