And though without rival he shine in the course,
To rein the fierce steed though unequal his force,
Tho' matehless the swiftness with which he divides.
In crossing the Tiber, the rough-swelling tides,
Yet shut the fond door at evening's first shade,
Nor look down to the street at the sort serenade;
Or if eruel he call thee in loye-sighing strain,

Yet more and more crue} be sure to remain.
