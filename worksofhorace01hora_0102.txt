ODE XII.
ΤΟ MAEGENAS.

N UMANTIA'S wars, sor years mahltailsdJ
Or Hannibal’s vindictive ire,

Or seas with Punic gore distain’d,
Suit not the sosmess of my feeblo lyre 2

Nox· savage Centaurs mad with wine,
Nor Earth's gigantic rebel brood,

who shook old Saturn’s scats divine5
Tin by the arm of Hercules subdu'd.

You in historic proso shall ten

The mighty power of Caesar’s war ς
How kings beneath ffis battle fell,

Or dragg'd indignant his triumphal car.

Licymnials dulcet voice, her eye
Bright-darting its respl‘endent ray,

Her breast, where love and friendship Iie7
The muse commands me sing in soster laj·

In raillery the sportive jem,

Graceful her mien in dancing charms, ’
When playful at Diana’s feast

To tho bright virgin choix· she winds her amm:

⁵Say, shall the wealth by kings possest,
Or the rich diadems they wear,
Or all the tresures of the Eam,
Purchase one look os my Licymnia’s hair T:

While now her bending neck she plica
Backward to meet the burning kiss,
*Thon with an easy cruelty denies, ⁷ L
Yet wishes you would snatch, not ask the mise-‘t
