ODE XIII.
TO THE FOUNTAIN BA-NDUSIA.

FOUNTAIN, whose water-s far surpass
The shining face of polish’d glass,
To thee, the gobiet‚crown'd with flowersf
Grateful the rich libation pours ;
A goat, whose horns hegin to spread,
And bending arm his swelling head,
whose bosom glows with young desires.
Which war or kindling love inspires,
Now meditates his blow in vain,-
His blood shall thy fair fountnin stain.
When the fierce dog-star's fel-vid ray
Flames forth, and sets on fire the day,
To vagrant fiocks, that range the field,
You a refreshihg coolness yield ;
Or to the labour-wearied team
Pour forth the freshness of thy stream.
Soon shalt thou fiow a noble spring,
While in immor-tal verse I sing
The oak that spreads thy rocks around,
From whence thy babbling waters bound.
