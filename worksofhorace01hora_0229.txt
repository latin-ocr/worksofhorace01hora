THE SEGULAR POEM. 213

'³ .Dost from thy beamy car unfold
The glorious day,
Or hide it in thy setting ray,
Of light and life immortal source,
Mayst thou, in 2211 thy radiant course,
Nothing more great than seven-hiss'd Rome behold-

Chorus of Virgins.

Goddess-of the natal hour,
Or, if other name more dom,
Propitious power,
Can charm your ear,
Οῗιι· pregnant matrons gracious hear 2
With lenient ham} their pangs compose‘
Heal their agonizing throes ;
Give the springing birth to light,
And with every genial grace,
Prolific osan endless race,
Oh! crown our marriage-laws, and bless the nup
tial rite:

Chorus os Youths and Vir-gius.

That when the circling years complete
Again this awfu] season bring.
Thrice with the day's revolving ligbr,
Thriee beneatb the shades of night,
ΤΠ countless hands our youthful choirs may sing
These erstal hymns, these pious gamos repeat.

Ye Fates‚ from whom unerring flows
The word of truth; whose firm decree

-rts‘stated bounds and order knows,
wide-spreading through eternityf
