Γ ones, BOOK 1v. ’ 1613

ᾗ Rome and her holy fathers cry, Thy stay
W as promis'd short, ah' wherefore this aalays!

Come then, auspicious prince, and bring
To thy long gloomy country, light,
For in thy countenance the spring
. Shines forth to cheer thy people’s sight :
'l'hen hasten thy return : for, thou away,
ἓ Nor lustro has the sun, nor joy the day.

As a fond mother views with sear
The terrors os the rolling main,
While envious winds, beyond his year,
From his lov'd home her son detain ;
. Το the good gods with fervent prayer she eries}
And catches every omen as it flies 3

Τ hen anxious listens to the roar
Of winde, that loudly sweep the sky ς
Nor, searsul, from the windiug shore
Can ever turn her longing eye z
§mit with as faithful and as fond desires,
Impatient Rome her absent lord requires.

ὲ Sase by thy cares her oxen graze,

⁷ And yellow Ceres clothes her fields ;

¹ The sailor ploughs the peaeeful sens,

ι “ And Earth her richer abundance yieldsss

‘¹ W hile, nobly eonseious of unsullied same,
Γ cur honom dreads th' imputed sense of blame

By thee our wedded dames sare pure
From foul adultery⁷s embrace;
,ι . T he eonseious father views secure

His own resemblance in his race ;
