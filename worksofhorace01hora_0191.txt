Once happy maid. ¹ in pleasing guiles
j who vied with cynara' m smiles,

3 Ah! tragicas survival!
She glorious died m beauty⁷ s bloom‚

“ y While cruel Fata defers thy doom

To be the raven' s rival.

ι 'rhat youths, in fervent wishes bold,

’· ἡ Not without laughter may behold

A torch‚ whose early fite

.ss could every breast with love inflame, '

Now faintly spread a sickly gleam,
*r And in a smake expire.
