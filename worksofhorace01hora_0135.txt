ἰὼ,- 'ro AsTERIE.

.‚ AH! why does Asterie thus weep for the youth
ι , Os constancy faithful, of honour and truth,
·.'. YVhom the first kindly zephyrs, that breathe o'er
η the spring,
η - Enrich'd with the wan-es of Bithynia shall bring 2
⁴ Driven back from his course by the tempests, that
nse
then stars of mad lustre rule over the skies,
At Oricum now poor Gyges must stay,
Where sleepless he weeps the eold winter away ;
While his landlady Chloe, in sorrow of heart,
Δ Bids her envoy of love exert all his art,
- „ who tells him how Chloe, unhappy the dame ἰ
Deep sighs for your lover, and burne in your flame²
’ἰ He tells him how Proetus‚ deceiv'd by his wife,
Attempted,ah dreadful! Bellerophon's life,
’ And urg'd by false crimes, how he sought to de-
stroy
The youth sor refusing, too chastely‚ the joy z
How Peleus was almost despatch'd to the dead,
While the lovely Magnessian abstemious he fied.
Thea he turns every tale, and applies it with art
To melt down his virtue, and sosten his heart;
1³3But constant and beart· whole young Gyges αρ’
pears,
And deaser than rocks the tale· tener hears.
Then, fair· -one, take heed‚ lest Enipeus should prove
A little too pleasing, and tempt thee to love:
