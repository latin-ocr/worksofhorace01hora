26 THE WORKS OF HoRACE.

To whom shall Jove assign to purge away
The guilty deed ’.ἱ Come then, bright god of das
But gracious veil thy shoulders beamy-bright‚
Oh ! veil in clouds th? unsufferable light.
Or come, sweet queen os smiles, while round thee
rove,
On wanton wing, the powers of mirth and love ς
Or hither‚ Mars, thine aspect gracious bend,
And powerful thy neglected race- defend,
Parent of Rome, amidst the rage of fight
Sated with soenes of blood, thy fierce delight,
Thou, whom the polish'd belm, the noise of arms„
And the stern soldier's frown with transport warms.
Or thou, sair Maia's winged son, appear,
And human shape‚ in prime ofmanhood, wetu- ;
Declar'd the guardian of th² imperial state,
Divine avenger of great Caesar’s 'fate ε
Oh! late return to heav’n, and may thy reign
With lengthen⁷d blessings fill thy wide domflin :

’ Nor let thy people’s crimes-provoke thy flight,

On air swift-rising to the realms oflight.

Great prince and father of the state, receive
The noblest triumphs which thy Rome ean give -,

Nor let the Parthian, with unpunish'd pride,
{Beyond his bound's, OCaesar, dare to ride.
