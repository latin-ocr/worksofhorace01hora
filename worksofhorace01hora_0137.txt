ODE VIII.
ΤΟ MAECENAS.
THE Greek and Roman languages are thino.

⁴ ⁴ . Their hallow'd customs‚ and their rites divine ;

And well you might the flowery wreaths admira.

The fragrant incense, and the sacred fire,

Rais’d on the living turf, to hail the day

To which the married world, their homage pay.
When on my'head a tree devoted fell,

And almost crush⁷d me to the shadee os hell,

Grateful Ι vow'd to him, who rules the vine,

A joyous banquet‚ while beneath his shrine

A snow-white goat should bleed3 and when the γεω

Revolving bids this festal morn appear,

We’ll pierce a oask with mellow juice replete,

Meuow’d with smoke since Tullus rul'd the state.
Come then, Maecenas, and for friendship⁷s sake,

A friend preserv'd, a hundred humpers take.

Come drink the watchsul ‘tapers up to day,

While noise and quari-ele shall be far away.

No more let Rome your anxious thoughts engage

The Dacian falls beneath the victor's rage,

The Medes in civil wars their arms employ,

Inglorious wars! each other to destroy ;

Our ancient roes, the haughty sons of Spain,

At length, indignant, feel the Roman chain ;

With bows unbent the hardy Scythians yield,

‘⁴ Resolv’d to quit the long-disputed field.
’ No more the public claims thy pious sears :

Be not too? anxious then with private cares,
But seize the gists the present moment brings,
These fleeting gists, and‘l‘ea've severe-r things,
