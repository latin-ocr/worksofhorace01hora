ODE VI.
TO THE ROMANS‘

THOUGH guiltless of your father-3⁷ crimes,

Roman, 'tis thine, to latest times,

The vengeance jof the gods to bear,

Tin you their awful domes repair,
Prosan'd with smoke their statues raise.
And bid the sacred altars blaze.

That you the powers divine obey,
Boundless on earth extends your sway 2
From hence your future glories date,
From hence expect the hand of Fate.
'rh’ offended gods, in horrors dire,

On sad Hesperia pour’d their ire :

The Parthian squadrons twice repell'd
Our inauspicious powerS, and quell'd
Our boldest efforts, while they shone
With spoils from conque12⁷d Romans worn
The Dacians. whose unerring art

Can wing with death the pointed dart;
‘rh’ AEgyptian, sorbis nav-'ies fam’d,
Had Neptune⁷s boundless empire elaim’dv
And almost in‘ their rage destroy'd
Imperial Rome, in civil strise employ'd.

Fruitful of crimes, this age first stain'd
Their hapless offspring, and profan’d
The nuptial bed, from whence the woes⁴
That various and unnumber'd rose
From this polluted sountain-head,

O'er Rome and 0⁷er the natione spread.
