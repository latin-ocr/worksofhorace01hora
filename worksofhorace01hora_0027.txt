venai and Horace, with regat-d to style, may with
ease be decidod. In Juvenal the vices of his age
are shown in all their natural horrors. He com—
mands his readers in the language of authority, and
terrifies them with images drawn in the boldness of
atruly poetical spirit. He stands like a priest at
an altar sacrificing to his gods ; but even a priest,
in his warmest zeal of religion, might be forgiven,

who indulges his natural sagacity in adiscernment
of their faults, and feels an ill—natured pleasure in
exposing them to public view.

in general, so happy an art of correcfingfflem, that
he reproves without offending, and instructs with=
out an affectation of superiority. He preserves a
strength of reasoning necessary to persuade, with>-
