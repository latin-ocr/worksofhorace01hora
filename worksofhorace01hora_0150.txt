136 THE woRKs οιὲἼ HORACE.

ODE XVI.
TO MAECENAS.

OF watchful dogs an odious ward
Might well one hapless virgin guard,
When in a tower of brass' immur'd,
And by strong gates of ¹0:11< secur'd,
Although by mortal *gtillams lewd
With all their midnigljigffiyts pursu' d ,
Had not great Jove and Venus fair
Laugh’d ather father⁷s fruitless care:
For well they knew no fort could hold
Against a god transform⁷d to gold.

Stronger than thunder’s winged force
All-powerful gold can speed its course,

Through watchful guards its passdge make,

And loves through solid walls to break :
From gold the overwhelming woes,
That crush’d the Greeian augur, rose;
Philip with gold through cities broke,
And rival monarchs felt his yoke;
Captains of ships to gold are slaves,

Though fieroe as their own winds and waveS.

Yet anxious care, and thirst of more,

Attend the still increasing store.
While you in* humble rank appear,

Gracing the knighthood that you wear,

By your example taught, Ι dread

‘1¹0 raise the far conspicuous head.

The more we to ourselves deny,

The monte the gods our wants supply.

Far from the quarters of the great,

Happy, though naked, 1 retreat,

,εὖ
