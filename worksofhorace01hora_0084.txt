ODE IV.v

TO XANTHIAS PHOCEUS.

LET not my Phoceus think it shame
For a fair slave to own his flame 3
A slave could stern Achilles move,
And bend his haughty soul to love :
Ajax, invincible in arms,
&Vas captiv²d by his captive's charms ι
Atrides ’midst his triumphs mourn'd,
And for a ravish'd virgin burn'd,
What time the fierce barbarian hands
Fen berelides’ conquering hands,
&nd Troy (her Hector swept away)
Bccame to Greece an easier prey.
Who knows, when Phyllis is your bride.
To what fine solk you'll be allied 2
{Ier parents dear, of gentle race,
Shall not their son-in-law disgrace.
She sprang from kings, or nothing less.
And weeps the family⁷s distress.
Think not that such a charming she
( *an of the wretched vulgar be,
A maid 7 so faithful and so true
Τι’) love, to honour, and to you ἔ
Her dear mamma, right-virtuous dame,
Gould ne'er have known the blush of sham(·.
While thus with innocence I praise,
{iet me no jeaious transports raise.
lIeart-whole and sound I laud her charms.
Her sace, her taper legs, her arms ;
For, trembling on to forty years,
λῖς age forbids αῖ] ⁸jkalous fears.
