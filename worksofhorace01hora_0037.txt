'ro sns'rms,

FIERCE winter melts in vernal gales,

And grateful zephyrs fill the spreading sails ;
No more the ploughman loves his fire,

No more the lowing herds their stalls desire,
While earth her richest verdure yields,

Nor hoary frosts now whiten o'er the fields.
Now joyous through the verdant meads,

Beneath the rising moon, fair Venus le'ads
Her various danee, and with her train

Of Nymphs and modest Graces shakes the plain.
While Vulcan's glowing breath inspires

The toilsome forge, and blows up au its fires.
Now crown’d with myrsse, or the flowers

Which the glad earth from her Free bosom p'ours.
We'll offer, in the shady grove,

Or lamb, or kid‚ as Pau shall best approve.
With equal pace impartial Fate

Knocks at the palace as the cottage gate ;
Nor should our sum of life extend

Our growing hopes beyond their destin’d end.
When sunl< to Pluto’s shadowy coasts,

Opprest with darkness and the sabled ghosts.
No more the dice shall there assign

To thee the jovial monarehy of wine.
No more shall you the sair admire,

The virgins' envy, and the youth’s desire.
