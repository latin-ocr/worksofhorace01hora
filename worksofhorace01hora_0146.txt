Boy, bring us essence,bring us crowns ;
Pierce me a cask of ancient date,
Big with the storied Marsian war,
And with its glorious deeds replete,
If yet one jovial cask remain
Since wandering Spartacus o⁷erswept the plaiu‘

Invite Neaera to the feast,
Who sweetly chal-ms the listening ear,
And bid the fair one'sspste to bind
In careless wreathe'her essenc'd hair ;
But should her porte'r bid you stay,
Leave the rough‚ surly rogue, and come away.

When hoary age upon our heads
Pours down its chilling weight of sumtus,
No more the breast with anger bu'rns,
No more with amorous beat it glows τ
Such treatment Horace would not bear,
When warm with youth, when Plancus fill'd the
consul’s chair.
