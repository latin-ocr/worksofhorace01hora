Let her the golden mine despise;
For deep in earth it better lies,
Than when by hande profane, from nature's stote5
Ῥο human use compell’d, flames forth the sacred
ore.

WVhere nature's utmost limite end,
Let her triumphant arms extend;
Or where the sun pours down his madding beams,
Or where the clouds are dax-k, and rain perpetual
streams.

Thus let the wal-like Romans reign
(So Juno and the Fates ordain,) '
But on these terms galone, no more to dare,
Through piety or pride, their parent Troy repaix· g

For Troy rebuilt,'111-o1nen’d state!
Shall feel the same avenging fate:
Again my Greeians shall victorious prove,
By me led on to war, the sister-wife of Jove.

Thrice should Apollo mise her wall,
Thrice shall her brazen bulwarks fall,
Thrice shall her matrons feel the victor’s chain, ²
Deplore their slaughter'd sons, deplere their ΙΜΞἶ
hands slain.

But whither would the Muse aspire?
Such themes nor suit the sportive lyre,v
Nor should the wauton, thus in feeble stra‘m, ι ,
'The couneus of the gods. immortal the-mes* p'ros j '
faste. ξ
