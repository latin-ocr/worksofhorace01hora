omes, BOOK 111. 109

'1¹0 silence due towards we ginz
And they who mysteries reveal
Beneath my roos shall never live,
-, Shall never hoist with me the doubtful sau.

ἒ When Jove in anger strikes the blow,

Ξ 0st with the bad tho righoeous bIeed :

“ Yet with sure steps, though lame and elow,
Vengeance o’extakes the tremblin g villain's speed.
