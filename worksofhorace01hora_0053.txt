ODE XVI.
ΤΟ TYNDARIS.

DAUGHTER, whose loveliness the bosom warms
“ More than thy lovely mother's riper char-ms,
,ἓ Give to my bold lampoons what sate you please‚
ἐ To wasting flames oendemn'd‚ or angry sees.
But yet remember‚ nor the god of wine,
Nor Pythian Phoebus from his inmost shrine,
Nor Dindymene, nor her priests possest‚
Can with their sounding cymbals shake the breast
Like furious anger in its gloomy vein,
Which neither temper⁷d sword, nor raging main,
Nor fire wide-wasting, nor tremendous Jove
Rus ehing m baleful thunders from above,
Can tame to sear. Thus sings the poet' s lay·-
Prometheus to inform his nobler clay

Their various pass ions chose from ev 'ry beast,
And with the lion' s rege inspired the human breasr
From anger all the tragic horrors rose 7
That crush'd Thyestes with a weight of woes ;
From hence proud cities date their utter falls,
'Whem insolent' m ruin, o 'er their walls
The wrathful soldier drags the hostile plough
That haughty mark of total overthrow. ⁴
ἒ Me too in youth the heat of anger fir' d,
And with the rapid rage os rhyme' mspir 'd
But now repentem, shall the Muse again
'I'o soster numbers tune her melting suain,
So thou reeajl thy ‘threats7 thy wrath controulf
Rusume thy‘epve, and give me back my seul.
