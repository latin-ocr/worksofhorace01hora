To MAECENAS

v'WHEN shall we quaff your old Caecubian winc- .
Reserv'd sor pious feasts and joys divine ’.ἱ
Οωεᾶζ with conquest comes, and gracious Jove,
who gave that conquest, shall our joys approve»
Then bid the breath of harmony inspiro
The Dorio fimo, and wake the Phrygiam Iyre ;
As late, when the Neptunianyouth, who spurn‘o
A morta} birth, beheld his navy· burn'd,
And fied affrighted through his father⁷s waves
With his perfidious host; his host of sIaves,
Freed from those chains with which his tage dg*
sign'd,
Impious ! the free-born sons of Rome to bind.
The Roman troops (th be the tale denied
By futtuo times) enslav⁷d to womnn's pride,
And to a wither⁷d eunuoh’s will severe
Basely subdu'd, the toils of war could bear?
Amidst the Roman englesS'ol survey’d,
Ο shame! th’ Egyptian canopy diSplay'd2
When twice a thousand Gauls aloud proclaiml.
Indignantrat the sight, great Caesar⁷s name,
And a brave fleat, by just resentmenfled,
Turu'd their broad pro-wsr and to our have-ns Ηόδὲ..
Come, god of triumphs, bring the golden ear·⁴
The untam'd, heisers, aud the spoils os war ι
Eser he, whose virtue rais'd his awful tomb
0251 ruin‘d carthag-e, ne’er returnkl to Rome
