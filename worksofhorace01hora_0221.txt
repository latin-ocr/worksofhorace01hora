Ο ΔΕΞ, BOOK V.
Till, by the rapid heat ealcin’d,
Vagrant 1 drive before the wind.
How long z-What ransom shall I pay 7
Speak—-I the stern command obey.
To expiate the gullty deed,
Say, shall a hundred bullocks bleed ’ἒ
Οι· shall 1 to the lying stt-ing
Thy fame and spotless virtue sing?
Teach thee, a golden star, to rise,

And deathless walk the-spangled skins '2'
When Helen's virtue was defam'd,
Her brothers, though with rage inflam‘d.

Yet to the hard his eyes restor⁷d,

then suppliant he their grace implor‘d.
Oh! calm this madness of my braim,

For you can heal this raging pain.

You never knew the birth of shame,

Nor by thy hand, all-skilsul dame,

The poor man’s ashes are upturn⁷d,

Though they be thrice three days inurn‘d. ν

Thy bosom⁷s bounteous and humane,
Thy hand from blood and murder clean
And with a blooming race of boys

Luqina crowns thy mother-joy&²
