ἑ* NOR everlastingvrain deforme

3 ’ἤιε squalid fields; nor endless storms2
³ Inconstam, vex the Caspian maim
Nor on Armenia's srozen plain

The loitering snow unmelting lies 3
Nor, lond, when northern winds arise.
The labouring forests bend the head ,-
Nor yet their leafy honours shed :
Yet still in elegiae strains

My Valgius for his son complains.
When Vesper lifts his evening ray..
Or flies the rapid beam of Day.

Not for his son the Grecian sage7
Renown'd sor thrice the mortal age ;
Not for their youthful brother dead 7
Such sorrows Priam’s daughters shed.

At length these weak complaints give ωέι .
ludulge th' unmanly grief no more :
But let us holder sweep the string‚

And Caesar⁷s new-rais'd trophies sing ς
The Tigris, and its sreezing flood,
Euphrates, with its realms, subdu'd ;
Whose waves are taught with humbler prim
Smoother to roll their lessening tide;

She Scythiam, who reluctant yield:

Nor pour thegzzpquadronys o’er the field.
