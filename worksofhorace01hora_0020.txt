xii PREFACE.

particularly appointed to celebrate the praises of
the gods and heroes in their festivals. The noblest.
precepts of philosophy were enlivened by music,
and animated by the language of poeti-y, while
reason governed the raptures, which a religious en-
thusiasm inspired. We may therefore believe, that
nothing could enter into its compositions‚ but what
was chaste and correct, awful and sublime, while
it was employed in singing the praises of gods, and
immortalizing the actions of mem in supporting
the sacred truths of religion, and enoouraging the
practice os moral virtue. Such was its proper, na-
tural character. But it soon lost this original ex*
cellence, and became debased to every light de-
scription oflove‚ dances, feasts, gallantry, and wine.
In this view it may be compared to one of its first
masters, who descended (according to an expres·
sion of Quintilian) into sports and loves, although
naturally formed for nobler subjects.

Yet this alteration, though it lessened its natural
dignity, seems to have added to that pleasing va-
riety, to which no other poeti-y can pretend. For
when the skill and experience of the persons, who
first cultivated the different kinds of poemS, gave
to each kind those numbers, which seemed most
proper for it; as lyrie poetry had given birth to all
sorts of verse, so it preserved to itselfall the meas·-
ures of which they are composed, the pentameter
alone excepted. Thus a variety of subjects is
agreeably maintained by a variety of numberS, and
they have both contributed to that free, unbounded
spirit, which forms the peculiar character of lyr-io
poetry.
