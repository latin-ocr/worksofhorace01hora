Onne, Boon 11.

You break into your neighbour's gamudS,

, And overleap your client’s bounds.

Driven out by thee, to new ebodes

They carry their paterna} gods ;
ζ The wife her husband’s sorrow shares,
And on her breast her squalid infante bears.

Yet, destin’d by unerring Pate,
Shall death this wealthy lord await ; ·
Then whither tend thy wide demesnes ’ἓ
For Earth impartial entertains
Her various sone, and in ber breast
Princes and beggars equa! rest.

Nor gold could bribe, nor art deceive,

The gloomy lise-guard of the grave
· Backward to tread the shadowy way ,

And wast Prometheus into day.

Yet he who Tantalus detainS,

With all his haughty race, in chains,
Invok’d or not, the wretch receives,
And from the toils of life relieves,
