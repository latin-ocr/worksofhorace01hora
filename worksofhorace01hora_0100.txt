ODE XI.
ΤΟ QUINTIUS HIRPINUS

BE not anxious, friend, to know
What out fierce Cantabriam foe,

What intends the Scythian’s pride>5
Far from us whom seas divide.
Tremble not with vain desitas,
Few the things which life requires
Youth with rapid swiftness flies,
Beauty's lustre quickly dim,
WVither⁷d Age drives far away
Gentle sleep and amorous play.
When in verna] bloom they glow,
Flowers their gayest honours showe
Nor the moon with equal grace
Always lists her ruddy face.
'rhus while natm-0⁷5 works decay,
Busy mortal, prithee say,
Why do you fatigue the mind,
Not for endless schemes design'd?
Thus beneath this lofty shade,
‘rhus in carexess sreedom laid,
While Assyriam essence sheds
Liquid fragrance on our heads,
While we lie with roses crown’d7
Let the cheerful bow} go round:
Bacchus can our cares controul,
Pares that prey upon the seul.
