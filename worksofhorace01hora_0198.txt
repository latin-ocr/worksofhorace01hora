184 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

ODE 11.
THE PRAIsEs oF A coUNTRY ΗΒΕ.

LIKE the first mortals blest iS he,

From debts, and usury, and business free,
With his own team who ploughs the soil,

Which grateful once confess'd his father’s toil.
The sounds of war nor break his sleep,

Nor the rough storm, that harrows up the deep ἕ
He shuns the courtier⁷s haughty doors,

And the loud science of the bar abjures.
Sometimes his marriagable vines “

Around the lofty bridegroom elm he twines ς
Or lops the vagrant boughs away,

Ingrasting better as the old decay ;
01· in the vale with'joy surveys

His lowing herd sare-wandering as they gramm
Or careful stores the flowing gold

Prest from the hive, or sheers his tender sold ;
Or when, with various fruits o'erspread‚

The mellow Autumn lifts his beauteous head,
'His grafted pears or grapes, that vie

With the rich purple of the Tyrian dye,
Grateful he gathers7 and repays

His guardian gods upon their festa] days; ·
Sometimes beneath an ancient shade‚

Or on the matted grass supinely laid,
XVhere pours the mountain stream along,

And feather’d warblers ebant the soothing song;
Or where the lucjd sountain flows‚

And with it's murmurs com-ts him te reposo.
