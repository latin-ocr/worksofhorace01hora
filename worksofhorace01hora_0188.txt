174 THE WORKS OF HORACR

All hands employ'd; with busy haste
1 My boys and girls prepare our feast:
ἶ Trembling the pointed flames arise,
1 The smoke rolls upward to the skies.
¹ But why this busy, festal care ’1
: This invitation to my fair?
¹ This day the smiling mouth divides,
O'er which the sea-born queen presides ζ

Saered to me, aud due to mirth,

As the glad hour that gave me birth ;

For, when this happy morri appears,

Maecenas counts a length of years

Το roll in bright succession round,

With every joy and blessing crown'd.
Gay Telephus exults above

The humble fortunes of thy love;

A rich and buxom maid detains

His captive heart in willing chains.
The youth destroy'd by heavenly fire

Forbids ambition to aspire ;

And Pegasus, who scorn'd to bear

His earth-born rider through the air,

A dread example hath supplied

To check the growth of human pride,

And caution my presumtous fair

To grasp at things within her sphere.
Come then, my latest love (for 1

Shall never for another die.)

Come learn with me to newer lays

. Thy voice of harmony to raise.
The soothing song‘and charming air
ς Shall lesscn every gloomy care.
