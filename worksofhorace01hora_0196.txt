ODE Ι.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.
WHILE you, Maecenas, dearest friend,

Would Caesar⁷s person with your own defend ἑ ,

And Antony⁷S high-towered fleet

With light Liburnian galleys fearless meet,
What shall forsaken Horace do,

&Vhose every joy of life depends on you?
With thee ⁷tis happiness to live,

And life, without thee, can no pleasure g1ve.
Shall I th'unkind command obey,

And idly waste my joyless hours away?
Or, as becomes the brave, embrace

she glorious toil, and spurn the thoughts of pea·
1 will: and over Alpine snow,

Or savage CaucasuS‚ intrepid go:
Or follow, with undaunted bre-ast,

Thy dreadsul w arfare to the furthest west.
Yyou ask, what aid Ι can afford,

A puny warrior. novice to the sword.
