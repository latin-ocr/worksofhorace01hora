3ο THE woRKsoF nomen.

ODE' v.
'ro- PYRRHA.

WHILE liquid odours round him breathe,

What youth, the rosy bower beneath,
Now courts thee to be kind? ’

Pyrrha, for whose unwary heart

Do you, thus drest with careless art,
Your yellow tresses bind Ἰ

How often shall th⁷ unpraotis⁷d youth

Of alter'd gods, and injur'd truth,
With team, alas ! complain ’.Ρ

How soon behold with wondering eyes

The black’ning winds tempestuous rise,
And scowl along the main ’.Ρ

While, by his easy saith betray’d‚
He now enjoys thee, golden maid,
Thus amiable and kind;
He fondly hopes that you shall prove
Thus ever vacant to his love,
Nor heeds the faithless wind.

Unhappy they, to whom, untried‚
You shine‚ alas! in beauty’s pride ; ·
While 1, now sare, on shore.
Will consecrate the pictur’d stormh
And all my grateful vows perform
To Neptune’s saving power.
