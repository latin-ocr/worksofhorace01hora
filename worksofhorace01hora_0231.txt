‘ THE SECULAR POEM. 2152

For whom AEne-as, through the fire,
In which hev saw his Troy expire,
A passage open'd to a happier clime,
Where they might nobler triumphs gain.
And to never-ending time
With boundless empire reign:

Ye gods, inform our docile youth-

With early principles ostrutlu

Ye gods, indulge the waning days

Of silver'd age with placid ease,

And grant to Rome an endless racc,
Treasure immense, and every sacred grace.

The prince, who owes to benuty's queen his birth.
Who bids the snowy vietimfs blood
Pour forth to-day its purple flood,
Oh 2 may he glorious rule the conquered earth 3
But yet a milder glory show
In mercy to the prostrate foe!

Already the fierce Mede his arms revere&
Which wide extend th’ imperial επεὶ),
And bid th’ unwilling world oli-ey ;

‘Phe haughty Indian owns h'w fem-s,

And S'cythians, doubtful of their doom.
Await the dread resolves of Rome.

fama, Honour, Peme, celestial maid,
And Modesty, in ancient guise array’d,
And Virtue (with unhallow'd scorn
Τοο long neglected) now appear,
WhilePlenty fills her bounteous horn,

xm pours her blessings o'er the various yezir.
