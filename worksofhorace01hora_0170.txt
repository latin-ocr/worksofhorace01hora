ODE XXX.

ΤΟ MELPOMENE.

MORE durable than brass, the framC
Which here 1 consecrate to fame;
Higher than pyramids that rise,
With royal pride, to brave the skies ;
Nor years, though numberless the train.
Nor ssight of seasonS‚ wasting rain,
Nor winds, that loud in tempests break,
shall e'er its firm foundation shake,
Nor shall the funeral pyre consume
My same ; that nobler part shajlbloorn,
With youth unfading shall improve,
While to th’ immortal sane of Jove
The Vestal maids‚ in silent state
Ascending, on the pontiff wait.

With rapid course and deafening waves

where Aufidus impetuous raves,

And where a poor, enervate stream

From banishfl Daunus takes its name,

O'er wax-like realms who fix³d his throne,

Shall Horace, deathless hard, be known.

Who first attempted to inspire

With Grecian sounds t-he Roman lyre.
‘NJWith conscious pride, O Muse divine

Assume the honours justly thine ς ⁷

 

&Vith laurel wreaths'jmy head surround3
Such as the god of verse have crown'd.
