ODE VI.
To SEPTIMIUS

ᾗ , Δ SEPTIMUS, who hast vow'd to go
.' 4-- With Horace even to {arthest Spain)
Or see the fierce Cantabrian foe,
Untaught to bear the Roman chain,
’ἦν the barbaric Sy rts, with mad recoil
Where Mauritaniam billows ceaseless boil2

May Tibur to my latest hours

Afford a kind and calm retreat ;
Tibur, beneath whose lofty towers

The Greeians fix'd their blisssul seat:

umere may my labours end, my wanderings ‹ze-ase„
‘i'hete all my toils of warfare rest in peace ἶ

But should the partial Fates restlse
That puter air to let me breathe,
Galesus‚ thy sweet stream I’ll-choose,
XVhere floeks of richest fleeces bathe 2
Phalantus there his rural sceptre sway’d!
Uzzeertain offspring os a Spartan maid.

No spot so joyous smiles to me
Of this wide globe's emended shores .
where nor the labours of the hee
Yield to Hymettus’ golden stores,
ἒ( Nor the green berry of Venafran soil
Sweus witha ripen· flood of fragrant 053.
