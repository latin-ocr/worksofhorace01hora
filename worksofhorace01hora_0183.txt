' ODES, BOOK lv.

Nor columns, which the public raise,
Engrav'd with monumental praise‚

By which the breath of life returns

To heroes sleeping in their urns ;

Nor Hannibal, when swift he fied,

His threats retorted on his head ;

Nor impious Carthage wrapt in flame,
From whence great Scipio gain'd a name,
Such glories round him could diffuse

λ As the Calabrian poet’s muse ;

And should the bard his aid deny,
Thy worth shall unrewarded die.
Had envious silence left unsung

, The child from Mars and Ilia sprung,

How had we known the hero's fame,

'³ From whom the Roman empire came ‘l

The poet⁷s favour, voice, and lay's,

·’ Could AEacus from darkness raise,

Snatch'd from the Stygian gulfs of hell,
Among the blissful isles to dwell.

The Muse forbids the brave to die,
The Muse enthrones him in the sky z

> Alcides, thus, in heaven is plavd,
-, And shares with Jove th' immortal feast ι

 

:1² Thus the twin·stars have power to save
..·²'· The shatter'd vessel from the wave,
3 And vine-crown'd Bacchus with success

· ,γ His jovial votaries can bless.

Ver. Ι, 15
