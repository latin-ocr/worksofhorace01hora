“IF e 'er th⁷insu1ted powers had shed -
ΞΓὸεὶι* vengeance on thy perjur 'd head
if they had mark' d thy faithless truth
With one foul nai1‚or blacken' d tooth, γ
Again thy falsehood might deceive,
And 1 the faithless-vow believe.
But when, perfidious, you engage
To m‘eet high heaven' s vindictiveb tage.
Ι You rise, with heigten' d lustre fair,
Of all our youth the public care.
c It thrives with thee to be forsworn
By thy dead mother' s ha110w⁷ d urn:
By heaven, and all the stare that roll
l Ῐῐι silent circuit round the pole:
By heaven, and every nightly sign,
By every deathless power divine.
ff Yes; Venus laughs, the nymphs with snffl es·-
J The simple nymphs. ¹ behold thy wiles
And with the blood os some poor swain
1 By thy perfidious beauty slain,
ι Εἰετοε Cupid whets his buming darts
For thee to wound new lovers' hearts.
‹- Thy train of slaves grows every da) 7

nd they who swore to break thy cHain
Yet-haunt those impious doors agaim
