36 THE WORKS oF HORACE.
Now let the grateful evening shade,

The public walks, the publio park,
An assignation sweetly made

With gentle whispers in the dark t
While age morose thy vigour spareS‚
Be these thy pleasures‚ these thy cares.

The laugh, that from the corner flies,
The sportive fair-one shall betray 3

Then boldly snatch the joyful prize:
A ring ot bracelet tear away,
While she, not too severely coy,

Struggling shall yield the willing toy.
