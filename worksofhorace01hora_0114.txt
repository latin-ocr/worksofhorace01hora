qm: X1x.
'ro BACCHUs.

f SAW (let future times believe)
'Phe god of wine his lecturos give ;
’Midst rocks far distlant was the scene ·
With ears erect the satyrs stood,
⁴&nd every goddess os the wood
Listened th’ instructive, solemn strahr-

The recent terror heaves my breast,
Yet, with th' inspiring power possem,

Tumultuous joys my soul have warm’d ;

Dreadful, who shak'st the ivy spear,

'Uhy votary thus prostrate hear, .
And be thy rege, thy rage disarm'd.

Give me to sing, by thee inspir’d,
Thy priestesses to madness fir'd:
Fountains of wine shall pour along7
md, melting from the hollow tree,
The golden treasures of the hee,
And streams os milk shall fill the song

[vair Ariadne’s (πονῶ shall rise,
And add new glories to the skies x
While 1 to listening nations tell
How impious Pentheus' palace burn’d5
With hideous ruin overturn'd‚
A nd how the mad Lycurgus fell³
