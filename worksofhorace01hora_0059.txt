ODE xxm.

ΤΟ CHLOE.

CHLOE flies me like a fawn,
. Which through some sequester’d lawa
, Panting seeks the mother-deer,
ζ Not without a panio sear
’ Os the gently·breathing breeze,

    
   
   
    
     

And the motion of the trees,

If the curling leaves but shake,

If a‘lizard stir the brake‚

Frighted it begins to ἠθεῖε,
Trembling both at heart and knees.
But not like a tiger dire,

Nor a lion sraught with ire,

Ι pursue my lovely geme

Το destroy her tendet srame.
Haste thee, leave thy mother’s arms;
Ripe for love are an thy chartus.

ODE XXIV.
To VIRGIL.

vhy blush to weep sor one so dear ’ἒ
lweet muse, os melting voice and lyre,
)ο thou the'mornssul song inspire.
tuintilius-——sunk to endless rest,

NHEREFORE restrain the tendet tear?
