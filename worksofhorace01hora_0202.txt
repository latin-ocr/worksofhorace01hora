‘³33 THE WORKS oF HORACE=

ODE V.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WITCH CANIDIA.

BUT oh, ye gods, whose awful sway
neaven, earth, and human-kind obey‚
What can this hideous noise intend ’.ἱ
On me what ghastly looks they bend !
If ever chaste Lucina heard
Thy vows in hour os birth perferr'd ζ
Oh! by this robe's impurpled train ‚
Its purple pride, alas! how vain !

By the unerring wrath of Jove,
Unerring shall his vengeance prome ς
Why like a step-dame do you stare,
Or like a wounded tigress glare ’.Ρ

Thus while his sacred robes they tear.
The trembling boy prefers his prayer ;
Then naked stands , with sucha form
As might an impious Thracian charm.
Canidia, crown'd with writhing snakes
Dishevell'd, thus the silence breaks ⁷:

‘¹ Now the magio fire prepare,

And from graves uprooted tear

Trees‚whose horrors gloomy spread

Round the mansions of the dead ;

Bring the eggs and plumage foul

Of a midnight·shrieking owl ;

Be they well besmear'd with blood

‘Of the-blackest-venorn'd toad ῐ
