ODE XI.

TO PETTIUS.

*SINCE cruel love, Ο Pettius, pierc’d my beart,
How have I lost my once-lov⁷d lyric art ἱ

Thrice have the woods their leafy honour mourn'd,
Since for Inacl1ia⁷s beauties Horace burn'd.

How was I then (for I confess my shame)

Of every idle tale the laughing theme !

Oh! that Ι ne⁷er had known thejovial feast,
XVhere the deep sigh, that rends the labouring

breast,

‚ VVhere languor, and a gentle silence shows,

To every curious eye, the lover⁷s woes.

Pettius, how often o'er the flowing bowl,
*When the gay liquor warm'd my opening soul,
When Bacchus, jovial god, no more restrain’d

The modest secret, how have 1 complain’d,
That wealthy blockheads, ina female's eyes,
From a poor poet's genius bear the prize Ξ
’ But if a generous rage my breast should warm,
Ι swore—no vain amusements e'er shall charm
My aching wounds. Ye vagrant winds, receive
The sighs, that sooth the pains they should relieve„
- Here shall my shame of being conquer'd end,
Nor with such rivals will I more contend.
When thus, with solemn air, I vaunting said,

’ ’ Inspir’d by thy advice I homeward sped :

βαι ah! my feet 'm wouted wanderings stray,
And to no friendly doors my steps betray 3
There Ι surget my vows , forget my pride,
And at her threshold lay my tortur'd side.
