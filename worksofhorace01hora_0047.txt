ODE XII.
HYMN 'ro‘ JOVE.

· WHAT man, what hero, on the tuneful lyre,
j Or sharp-ton’d flute, will Clio choose to raise
‚- Deathless to fame? What god ‘l whose hallow d

name
The sportive image of the voice
shall in the shades of Helicon repeat,
On Pindus, or on Haemus, ever cool,
From whence the forests in confusion rose
To follow Orpheus and his song :
He, by his mother's art, with soft delay
Coum stop the river's rapid lapse, or check
The winged winds; with strings of concord sweet
Powerful the listening oaks to lead.
Claims not th⁷ eternal Sire his wonted praise ’.ἓ
Awsul who reigns o⁷er gods and men supreme?
Who sea and earth—this universal globe
With grateful change of ,seasons guides ;
From whom no being of superior power,
Nothing of equal, second glory, springS,
Yet first of all his progeny divine
Immortal honours Pallas claims t
God of the vine, in deeds of valour bold,
F air virgin-huntress os the savage tace,
And Phoebus, dreadsul with unerring dart,
.· Nor will 1 not your praise proclaim.
Alcides' labeum, and fair Leda’s twins,
Fam’d for the rapid race, sor wrestling fam'd,
Shall grace my song; soon as whose star benign
Through the fierce tempest shines serene,
