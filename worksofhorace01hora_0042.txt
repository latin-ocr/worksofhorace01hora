ODE VIII.
TO LYDIA.

BY the gods, my Lydia, tell,
Ah! why, by loving him too well,
Why you hasten to destroy
Young Sybaris. too am'rous boy ’ἒ
Why he hates the sunny plain,
While he ean sun or dust sustain C?
Why no more, with martial pride,
Does he among his equals ride;
Or the Gallie steed command
With bitted curb and forming hand?
More than viper’s balesul blood
Why does he sear the yellow flood ‘l
Why detest the wrestler’s oil,

While firm to bear the manly toil ’.Ρ
Where are now the livid scars

Of sporfive, nor ingloriouS, wars,
WVhen for the quon, with vigour thrown

Beyond the mark, his same was known ’.Ρ
Tell us, why this fond disguise,

In which like Thetis' son he lies,
Ere unhappy Troy had shed

Her funeral son-owe for the dead,
Lest a manly dress should fire

His soul to war and carnage dire.
