{3 THE womz's oF nomen.

No Laws, or human or divine,

Can the presumptuous race of man confine.
Thus, from the sun's ethereal beam

XVhen bold Prometheus stole th’ *enlivening flame.
Of severs dire a ghastly brood,

Till then unknown, th' unhappy fraud pursu'd;
On earth their horrors bale-sul spread,

And the pale monarch of the dead,
Till then slow-moving to his prey,

Precipitately rapid swept his way.
Thus did the venturous Cretan dare

To tempt, with impious wings, the void of οἰκ
Through hell Alcides urg’d his course z

No work too high for man's audacious soree.
Our folly would attempt the skies,

And with gigantic boldness impious rise ;
Nor Jove, provok²d by mortal pride,

Van lay* his angry thunderbolts aside.
