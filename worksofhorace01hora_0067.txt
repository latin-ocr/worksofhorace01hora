1 QUEEN of beauty‚ queen of smiles, ·
·' Lean, oh ! leave thy favourite isles ·

’ Α temple rises to thy fame,

XVhere Glycera invokes.thy name,

And bids the fragrant incense flame. -

With thee bring thy love-warm son,
'fhe Graues bring with flowing zone ,
The Nymphs, and jocund Mercury,
And sprightly 'Youth‚ who without thec-
Is nought but savage Libertye
