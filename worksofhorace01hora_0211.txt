ODES, BOOK V. ,ΡΑ-3

So great and glorious, nor could Libya's field
Το thee, O Triumph, such a leader yield.
Pursu’d by land and sea, the vanquish⁷d foe

“’ Hath chang'd his purple for the garb of woe :

With winds, no more his own ς with shatter⁷d fleet-
He seeks the far-fam⁷d hundred towns of Crete 3

v 'ro tempest—beaten Libya speeds his way,

Or drives a vagrant through th⁷ uncertain sea.
Boy, ‘bring us larger bowls, and fill them rouffii

With Chian, or the Lesbian vintage crown'd,

Or‘r'reh Caecubian, which may best restrain

All sickeuing qualms, and sortify the braini

Th' inspiring juice shall the gay banquet warlus

,Νστ Caesar's danger shall our fears alarum . ¹
