ODES, BOOK V. ,132

Absenee, my lorgi, increases fear3
The danger lessens' when the friend is near:
Thus, is the mother-bird for-sake
Her unfledgeld young, she dreads the gliding snake
ι With deeper agonies afraid,·
&Not that het presence could afford them aid.
‘³³'- With eheerful heart will I sustain4
ἷξῚό purchase your esteem, this dread campaign 2
{3- Not that my ploughs, with heavier mil,
⁹{Or with a larger team, may turn my soil ;

⁴ Not that my flocks, when Syrius reigns,
'May browse the verdure of Lucania’s plain& z

No} that my villa shall extend

,To where the walls of Tusculum ascend.
ζ Thy bounty largely hath supplied,

· Even with a lavish hand, my utmost pride ;
·. Nor will 1 meanly wish for more,
{grasteless in earth to hide the sordid store,
‚ Like an old miser in the play,

Or like a spendthrift squander it away.
