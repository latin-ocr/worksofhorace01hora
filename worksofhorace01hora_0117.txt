O'DES.

BOOK 111.

ODE Ι.

MONARCHS on earth their power exientb
Monarchs to Jove submissive bend,
And own the sovereign god,
With glorious triumph who subdu’d
The Titan tace, gig-antio brood'.
And shakes whole nature with his neth

When rival candidates contend,

And to the field of Mars descend
To urge th’ ambitious claim,

Some os illustrious birth are proud,

Some of their cliente vassal crowd,
And some of virtuejs fame.

’ Others the rural labour Iove,

And joy to plant the spreading grove.
The surrow'd glebe to turn ; ⁷

. Yet with impartial hand shall Fato

Both of the lowly and the great
Shake the- capacious urn.
