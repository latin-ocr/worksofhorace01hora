ODE XXIII.
TO PHIDYLE.

 

¹ 11³ on the new-born moon, with hadde supine5

 

My Phidyle, laborious rustic, prays ;

τ If she with incense, and a ravening swine,

And yearly fluite, her household gods ammase,

Nor pestilential storm shall smite her vines,

ἓ N or barren mildew shall her harvests feam

¹ Nor ‘shall her flocks, when the sad year declines,
Beneath its fruitage, feel th' autumnal air.

, Let the devoted herds, that lowing seed

In snow-topt Algidon's high-branching wood
Or the fair kine of rich Albania, hleed,
λ And stain the ponfiff’s hallow'd axe with bloodss

-ι The hale gods, around thy sacred fire,

’ἶ No vast profusion of the victim’ s gore,

But pliant myrtle wreaths alone require,
And fragrant her-bs, the pinus, rural storo.

¹ v A grateful cake, when on the hassow'd shrine
Offer'd by hands that know no guilty stain 2

v ἢ Shau reconcile th'offended powers divine,

 

When bleeds the pompous hecatomh iu vain,
