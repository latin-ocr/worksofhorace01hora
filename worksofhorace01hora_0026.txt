and the same unvaried expression. The free-born
spirit of poetry is confined in twenty constant syl-
lables, and the sense regularly ends with every se-
cond line, as if the writer had not strength enough

This unclassical kind of versification would be
particularly most unnatural in a translation ofHo‘

the persons of his dialogues converse almost in
epigrams. The translator has therefore followed

best manner os preserving that loose, prosaie poet-

esteemed one of his peonliar beauties.

If we consider the poetical spirit and numerous
variety of measures in his Odes, we may believe*
this careless versification in his Satires was not axz
effect of necessity, but ofjudgment. His frequent
use of proverbs and common phrases ; his different*
manner of expressing the same sentiment-s in his»
Odes and Satires, will convince us, that he really
thought a satirest and a poet were extremely dif-
ferent characters ; that the language os poetry
was as unnatural to the morality of satire, as a
low, familiar style to the majesty of an epic poem ;
or, as he himself expresses it,that the Muse of Sa-
tire walks on foot,whiie all her sisters soar into
the skies.
