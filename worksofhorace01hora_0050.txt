42 THE WORKS OF HORACE

ODE XIV.
ΤΟ ΤΗΕ REPUBLIC.

UNHAPPY vessel ! shall the waves again

Tumultuous bear thee to the saithless main ?

What would thy madness, thus with storm's to
sport ἔ

Cast firm your anchor in the friendly port.

Behold thy naked decks ; the wounded mast

And sail-yards g roan beneath the southern blast‚

Nor without ropes thy keel can longer brave

The rushing fury of th’ imperious wave t

Torn are thy sans, thy guardian gods are lost,

VVhom you might call in future tempests tost.

What though majestie in your pride you stood

A noble daughter of the Pontio w00d‚

You now may vainly boast an empty name,

Or birth conspicuous in the rosss os fame.

The mariner, when storms around him rise,

No longer on a painted stern relies.

Ah ! yet take heed, lest these new tempests sweep

In sportive rage thy glories to the deep.

Thou late my deep anxiety and sear,

And now my fond desire and tender care,

Ah ! yet take heed, avoid those fatal scas

'rhat roll among the shining Cyclades.
