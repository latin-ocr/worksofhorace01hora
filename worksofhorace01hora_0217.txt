ODE XVI.
TO THE ROMANS.

IN endless civil war, th' imperial state
By her own strength precipitates her fate.
that neighbouring nafions, fiercely leagu' d in-arms
that Porsena, with insolent alarms
’ Threatening her tyrant monareh to restore ;
What Spartacus, and Capua's rival power;
What Gaul, tumultuous and devoid‘os truth,
And fierce Germania, with her blue-eyed youth
What Hannibal, on whose accursed head
Our sires their deepest imprecations shed,
In vam attempted to her awful state,
shall we, a blood-devoted race, complete 'l
Again shall savage beasts these hills possess ἰ
And fell barbarians, wauton with success,
Scatter our city⁷s flaming ruins wide,
Or through her streets in vengeful triumph ride,
And her great founder's hallow’d ashes spurn,
That sleep uninjur'd in their sacred urn ’ἒ

But some, perhapS, to shun the rising shame

<Which Heaven approve) would try some happiex
scheme.

As the Phocaeans ost for freedom bled,

At length, with imprecated curseS, fied

And left to boars aad wolves the sacred sane,

With all their household gods, ador’d in vain;

So let us fly, as faras earth extends,

Or wheretlxe vagrant wind our voyage bends.
Shall this, or shall some better scheme prevails:

why do we stop to hoist the willing sail‘!
