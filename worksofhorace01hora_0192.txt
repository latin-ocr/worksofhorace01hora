178 THE WORKS ‚OF RORACE.

ODE XIV.
TO AUGUSTUS.

How shall our holy senate⁷s care,

Or Rome with grateful joy prepare
Thy monumenta] honours, big with fame,
And in her festal annals eternize thy name Ἰ

othon, where Sol with varied rays
The habitable globe surveys,
Greatest of princes, whose vindictive war
First broke th’ unconquer’d Gaul to thy triumphp‘l

car 2

For when thy legions Drusus led,
How swift the rapid Breuni fied !
The rough Genauni fell7 and, rais'd in vain
'fremendous on the Alps, twice overwhelm’d the
plain ”
Their haughty towers. With just success
While the good gods thy battle bless,
Our elder Nero smote with deep dismay
The Rhaetians huge of bu1k‚ and broke their firm
array.

Conspicuous in the martial strife,
And nobly prodigal of life,
Withvwhat prodigious ruins he oppress’d
For glorious liberty the death-devoted breast Ξ

As when the Pleiads rend the skies ν
In mystic donce, the winds arise,
And work the seas untam⁷d; such was the force,
With which through spreading fires he spurr⁷d his
soaming liorse.
