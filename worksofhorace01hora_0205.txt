ODES, BOOK V. 191

³ Thau you not burn m fierce desire,

As melts this piteh m smoky fire.

The boy, with lenient words, no more

ι Now< strives their pity to implore;
ι With rago yet doubtful what to speak,
ι Forth from his lips these eurses break: -
g Your spells may right and wrong remove,
“ But ne'er shall change the wrath of Jove ;
³ For, while I curse the direful deed,
, In vain shall all your victims bleed.

Soon'as this tortur⁷d body dies,
Δ Α midnight Fury will Ι rise :
ᾗ Then shall my ghost, though form’d of air,
⁸ Your cheeks with crooked talons tear,
' Unceasing on your entrails prey,
2 And fright the thoughts of sleep away ι
. Such horrors shall the guilty know,

Such is the power os gods below.

Ye filthy hags, with showers of stones

- The -vengeful crowd shall crush your bones ;

Then beasts of prey, and birds of air,
* Shall your unburied members tear,

And, while they weep their favourite boy,
My parents shall the vengeful sight enjoy,
