ODES, BOOK 111. 115

) Whose horr'id youth, elate with impious pride,
Unnumber⁷d‚ ou the sinewy force relied ε
Mountain on mountain pil’d they rais’d in air,

And shook the throne os Jove, and bad the Thun⁴

J But what could Mimas of enormous might, -

f Typhoeus, or Porphyrimx's threatning height,

ἔ Or bold Enceladus fierce darting far

'The trunks of trees uptorn'‚ dire archer of the war,

Though with despair and rage inspir’d they rose,

To sage Minerva's sounding shield oppose ’.Ρ

While Vulcan here in flames devour'd his way,
There niatron Juno stood, and there the god of day,

Res01v2d‚ tiu he had quell’d th' aspiring foe,
Never to lay asido th' unerring bow.
He tbe pure dew of fair Castalia loves,
There barhes his flowing hair, and haunts his natal

’ ill-counsell·d force, by its own native weight,
Precipitately sa11s; with happier fate
While the good gods upraise the just design,
And bold, unhauow’d schemes ‘pursue with wrath
divine,

This truth shall hundred-handed Gyas prove,
ff* And warm Orion, who with impious love

Tempting the goddess of the sylvan scene,
Ἇξεε by her virgin darts, gigantic vietim! slairr.
