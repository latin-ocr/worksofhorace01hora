And into hideous accents broke;

In sounds, how direful'! thus she spoke ι
- Ye powers of darkness and of hell,

· Propitious to the magio spell,

Who rule in silence o'er the night,
While we perform the mystie rite,

Be present now, your horrors shed,

In hallow’d vengeance on his head.
Beneeth the forest⁷s gloomy shade
While beasts in slumbers sweet are laid:
Give me the leecher, old and lew’d,

By barking village-curs pursued,
Expos'd to laughter, let him shine

Iu essenee—ah! that once was mine.
What! shall my strongest potions fail ‚
And could Medea's chal-ms prevail?
When the fair han-lot, proud of beart,

'Deep felt the vengeance of her art ;
Her gown, with powerful poisons dyed„
In flames enwrapp2d the guilty bride.
Yet every root and herb I know,

And on what steepy depths they grow,
And yet, with essenee round him shed,
,He sleeps in some bold harlot's bed ;
Or walks at large⁷ nor thinks of me,
By some more mighty witch set free.

But soon the wretch my wrath shall prove,
By spells unwonted taught to love 3 ἒ
Nor shall even Max-sian chal-ms have power,
Thy peace, Ο Varus to restore.

With stronger druge, a larger bowl

1‘11 fill, to bend thy haughty soul;
Sooner the seas to heaven shall rise,
And earth spring upwards to the skies,
