'² To ms MUSE.

WHILE in the Muse's friendship blest.

vNor sear nor grief shall break my rest;
Bear them, ye vagrant winds, away
And drown them in the Cretan sea.

Careless am 1, or who shall reign
The tyrant of the Scythian plain,

Or with what anxious sear opprest
Heaves Tiridates' panting breast.

Sweet Muse, who lov'st the virgin spring.
Hither thy sunny flow’rets bring,
And let thy richest chaplet shed
tts fragrance round my Lamia’s head:
For nought avails the poet's praise,
Unless the Muse inspire his lays.

Oh! string the Lesbian lyre agaim
Let all thy sisters raise the suain,
And consecrate to deathless fame
‘513‘ 10v⁷d‚ my Lamia‘s honour‘d name.
