Together let us raise the voice
To her, belov'd by Jove supreme ;
Let sair Latona be the theme,

,Qut tuneful theme, his beauteous choice.

Chorus os Youths.

Ye virgins, sing Diana’s fame,
{Vho bathes‘delighted in the limpid stream ς
Dark Erymanthus’ awful groves,
The woods that Algidus o'erspread,
Or wave on Csagus' verdant head,
Joyous th' immortal huntress loves.

Chorus os Virgine.

Ye boys7 with equal honour sing
Falx Tempe cloth’d with ever-blooming spring;
Then hail the Delian birth divine,
XVhose shoulders‚ beaming heavenly fite,
Grac'd with his brother’s warbling lyre,
And with the golden quiver shine.
