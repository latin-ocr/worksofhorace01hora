‘³ ODES, BOOK 11. ι

om: XV.

³ IN royal pride our buildings rise,
g'l‘he useless plough neglected lies;

  
   
   
     
 
   
  
  
 
    

»Th’ unmarrisd plane high waves the head
Above the elm ; while au around,

there once the olive pour'd its shade,

And its rich master’s cares repaid,

The violet and myrtle greets

The sensas with a waste of sweets ,

While vainly would Apollo’s ray

Th rough our thick laureis pour the da} .
Not ‘such were Cato’s sage decreeg.

Nor Romulus by arts like these

In wisdom form'd th' imperial ειν-εις,

And bid th’ unwilling world obey :

Though small each persona} estste,

The public revenues were great ;

A‘rcades were then by law confin'd,

Ner open'd to the northern wind ;

Or turf‚ or briek‚ whssre Fortune pleas'u.

Phe private dwelling humbly rais'd,

While awful to the powers divine

Rosa high to heaven the sacred shrine¹

&nd all the public structures shone

{nrich’d with ornamental stone.

gPonds broad as lakes our fields o’erspread ·

&Vasting their sragrance o'er the ground y. ,
