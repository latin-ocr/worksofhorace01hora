150 THE womzs OF nonime

And bid the chanting raven rise
When Phoebus gilde his orient skies‚
Ere speeds the shower-boding crow
Το lakes, whose languid waters eease to floxv.

Happy may Galatea prove,

Nor yet unmindsul of our love,
For now no luckless ye prevails,
Nox* vagrant crow forbi s the swelling sails.

Yet see what storms tumultuous rise,
While prone Orion sweeps the skies.
1 know the Adriatic main,

And western winds‚ perfidiously serene.

But may the rising tempest shake
Our soes, and dreadful o’er them break ζ
For them the blackening ocean roar,

And angi-y surges lash the trembling shore.

When on her bull Europa rode

Nor knew she prese-‘d th' imperial god,

Bold as she was, th' affrighted maid
The rolling monsters of the deep surveyfl.

Late sor the rural nymphs she chose
Eaeh flower, a garland to compose,
But now beneath the gloom os night,
Views nought but seas, and stars of feeble light!

Soon as she touch'd the Cretan shore,
My sire, she cries,—ah Ξ mine no more,
For every pious, tender name

Is madly lost in this destructive flame.

&Vhere am l,wretched and undone ’ἒ

And shall a single death atone

A virgin‘s crime 21 Or do my fears
Deplore the guilty deed with waking tearsz
