ODE XXVII.

· To HIS COMPANIONZ3

WITH glasses made for gay delight³ Γ ³¹

“ “ris Thracian, savage rage to fight,
1 With such intemperate, bloody fray
ῤ· Fright not the modest god away.

Monstrous ! to see the dagger shine
Amidst the midnight joys of wine.

Here bid this impious clamour cease, ,
And pre-ss the social couch in peacez

Say, shall 1 drink this heady wine,
Press⁷d from the rough Falernian vine
Instantfilet yonder youth impart
The render story os his heart,

By what dear wound he blisssul dies,
And whence the gentle arrow fiies. Α

What 2 does the bashful boy deny ἲ

‘r11en‚if1 drink itlet me die.
VVhoe’er she be, a gene-rous flame
Can never know the blush of shame=
Τ hy breast no slave-born Venus fires.
But sair, ingenuous Jove inspires.
Then sasely whisper in my ear,

For all such trusts are sacred here.

Ah 2 worthy osa better fiame 2
Un'nappy youth! is she the dame ἕ
Unhappy youth! how art thou lost,
ln what a sea of troubles test!

What drugs, what witchcrast‚ or what chamus-
VVhat god, can free thee from her arms ’.7
Scarce Pegasus can disengage

Thy beart from this Chimaera's uage,
