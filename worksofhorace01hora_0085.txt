omi: V.

SEE, thy heiser’s yet unbroke

ἶ To the labours of the yoke,

Nor hath strength enough to prove

Such impetuous weight of love.

 

Round the fields her fancy strays‚
O'er the mead she sportive plays ;
Now beneath the sultry boam
Cools her in the passing stream,
Now with frisking steerlings young
Sports the sauow graves among.

Do not then commjt a rape
On the crude, unmellow'd grape ;
Autumn soon, of various dyes,
Shau with kinder warmth mise,
Bid the livid clusters glow,

And a riper purple show.

Time to her shall count each day,
Which from you it takes away,
'rin with bold and sorward chan-ms
She shall rush into your arms.
Pholoe, the flying fair,
shall not then with her compare ;
Nor the maid of bosom bright,
Like the moon's unspotted light,
O’er the waves, with silver ruys,
When its floating lustro plays ;
Nor the Cnidian sair and young,
who. the virgin-cheir among,
