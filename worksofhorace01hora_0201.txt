ODE IV.

AS worm and lambs by nature disagree,
So is my hatred fir‘m to thee ;
Thou wretch‚ whose back with flagrant whips is
τοι-υς
whose legs with galling setters worm
Though wealth thy native insolence inflame,
A scoundrel ever is the same,

While you your thriee three ells os gown display,-
And stalk along the sacred way, ·

· Observa the free-born indignation rise,
Mark ἱ how they turn away their eyes:

This wretch‚ they cry, with public lashing flay’d
Till even the beadle loath'd his trade, ,

Now ploughs his thousand acres of demesne,
And wears the pavement with his train;

Now on the foremost benches sits, in spite
Of Otho, an illustrious knight.

From slaves and pirates to assert the main,
Shall Rome such mighty fleets maintain,

And shall those fleas, that d'readful rule the sea,
A pirate and a slave obey ’ἱ
