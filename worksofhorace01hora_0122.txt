ODE 111.

THE man, in conscious virtue bold,
Who dares his secret purpose hold,
Unshaken hears the crowd's tumultuous eries&
And the impetuous tyrant’s angry brow defles.

Let the wild winde, that rulo the seas
Tempestuous, all their horrors raise ;
Let Jove’s dread arm with thunders tend the
spheres,

Beneath the crush of worlds undaunted he appears.

· Thus to the flamy towers above,
The vagrant hero, son of Jove,
Upsoar’d with strength his own, where Caesar lies,
And (μαθέ, with glowing lips, the bowl⁷s immorta‘l

joys.

Lyaeus thus his tigers broke,
Fierce and indocile to the yoke ; q
Thus stom the gloomy regione of the dead, ⁴
On his paternal steeds, Rome’ls mighty founder fled; .

XVhen heaven's great queen with words benign

Address'd th' assembled powers divine

Troy, hated Troy, an umpire lewd, unjust, ,Ἰ

And a proud foreign dame, have sunk thee to the ὲ
dust.

 

'ro me, and wisdom’s queen decreed, ζ

With an thy guilty race to bieed, ¹ '1¹

What time thy haughty monaroh⁷s perjur’d sire .,’
M'oek'd the defrauded gods, and robb'd them os theiz·
