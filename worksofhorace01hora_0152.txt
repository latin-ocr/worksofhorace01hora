AELIUS‚ whose ancient lineage springs
From Lamusffounder os the name
(From whom a sacred line of kings
Shines through the long records ossame‚

From whom th’ illustrio't‘xs rece arose, .
Who first possess'd the Formian ›towers 1
And reign'd where Liris smoothly flows q
To fair Marioa's marshy shores) ἒ

If ffle old shower-foretelling erow

Croak not her boding note in vain,
'To-morrow’s eastern storm shall strow

The woods with leaves,with weeds the main,

Then pile the sue! while you may,

And cheer your spirit high with wine;
θεῖνε to your slaves one idle day,

And feast upon the fatted swine-
