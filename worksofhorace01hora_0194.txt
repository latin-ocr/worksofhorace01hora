180 THE woR'KS Q HORAeE.

ODE XV.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

l WOULD have sung of battles dire
And mighty cities overthrown,
When Phoebus smote me with his lyre,
And warned me with an angry tone,
Not to unfold my little sail, or brave .
The boundless terrors of the Tyrrhene wave.

Yet will l sing thy peaceful reign, 3
Which crowns with fruits our happy field= ⁸:-
And, rent from Parthia' s haughty fane,

To Roman Jove his eagles yields ;
Augustus bids the rage of war to cease,

And shuts up Janus in etex-nal peace.

Restrain⁷d by arts of ancient fame,
Wild License walks at large no more,

Those arts, by which the Latian name,
The Roman strength, th' imperial pow-'r,
With awful majesty unbounded spread
To rising Phoebus from his western bed.

While watchful Caesar guards our age,
Nor civil wrath, nor loud alarms
Of foreign tumults‚ nor the rage
That joys to forge destructive arms,
And ruin’d cities fills with hostile woes,
shall e’er disturb, Ο Rome, thy ease repose.
