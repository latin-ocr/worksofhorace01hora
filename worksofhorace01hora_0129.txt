ODE V.
THE PRAISES OF AUGUSTUS.

DREAD Jove in thunder speaks his just domain 3
, οη earth, a present god, shall Caesar reign,
Since world· divided Britain owns his ssway‚
And Parthia’ s haughty sons his high behes sts obe).

Ο name of country, once how sacred deem d’.

O sad reverse of manners, once es teem ’.d ¹

While Rome her ancient majesty maintain d:
In his own Capitol while Jove imperial reign'd,

Could they to foreign spousals meanly yield,

thom Crassus led with honour to the field?

Have they, to their barbarian lords allied,
Grown old in hostile arms beneath atyrant's pride„

Basely forgetful os the Roman name,
The heaven-descended shields, the Vestal flame-
That wakes eternal, and the peaceful gown,
These emblems which the Fates with boundlesf,
empire crown Ἰ

WVhen Regulus resus’d the terms of peace
Inglorious, he foresaw the deep disgraee,
WVhose foul example should in ruin end,

,v Α. And even. to latest times our baffled arms attend:

ξ Πῃῐθεξ the captive youth in‘servileffchains

. should sall unpitied. In the Punic sanes

” Have Ι not seen, the patriot captain cried,
'she Roman ensigns fix’d in monumenta] pride
