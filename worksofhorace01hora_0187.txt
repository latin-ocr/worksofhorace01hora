ΤΟ LIGURINUS.

,r O GRUEL still, and vain of beauty's chartus,

When wintry age thy insolence disarms ;

‘Vhen sall those looks that on thy shoulders play,

And youth’s gay roses on thy cheeks decay ;

WVhen that smooth face shall manhood⁷s roughness
wear,

Audin your glass another form appear ;

Ah why, you‘ll say, do [now vainly burn,

Or with my wishes not my youth return?

oDE xi.
TO PHYLLIS.

PHYLLIS, 1 have a cask of wine
Mellow⁷d by summere more than nine ;
With living wreaths to crown our heads
The parsley’s vivid verdure spreads ;

Τσ bind your hair the ivy twines,

With plate my eheerful sideboard shines;
With vervain chaste an altar bound,

Now thirsts sor blood; the victim’s crown’d.
