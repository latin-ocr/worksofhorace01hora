‘128 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

ODE X.

To LYCE.
THOUGH you drank the deep stream of Tanais

icy, . .
The wife of some barbarous blockhead, Ο Lyce,
Yet your beart might relent to expose me rechn'd
ν At your cruel-shut door to the tage of the wind.
Hark, your gate! how it creaks! how the grove,
planted* round
Your beautiful villa, re-bellows the sound ἱ
How Jupiter numbs all the regions below,
And glazes with crystal the fleeces of snow ἕ
Away with these humours os pride and disdain.

To Venus ungratesul, to Cupid a pain,

Lest while by the pulley you raise to the top,

Your rope should run back, and your bueket should
drop.

No sprightly Tyrrhenian begot thee a prude,

Another Penelope, harsh to be woo'd.

Ο, though neither presente, nor vow-sighing strain,

Nor violet painting the oheek of thy swain,

Nor thy husband, who gives up his heart for a ditty

To a song-singing weneh, can provoke thee to pity ;

Though like the hard oak you're to softness inclin'd.

And milder than all of the serpentine kind,

Yet think not this side can sor ever sustain

Thy threshold hard-hearted, and sky-falling rain. j
