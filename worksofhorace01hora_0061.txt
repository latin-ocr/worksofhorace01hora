ΤΟ LYDIA.

’ THE wauton herd of takes profest

·' 'Bhy windows rarely now molest.

’ With midnight rape, or break thy rest
With rior„

The door, that kindly once could move ⁷

The pliant hingo, begins to love

Βῆ threshold‚ and no more shall prove
Unquiet.

Now less and less assajl thine ear
These plaints, “ Ah, sleepest thou, my dear„
‘³ While 1 whole nights, thy true-love, here
“ Am dying ’.Γ
Yon in your turn shall weep the taunts
Qf young and insolent gallants,
111 some dark aney’s midnight haunts
Late plying 1

While raging tempests chill the skies‚
And burning lust (such lust as tries
The madding dams ef horses) fries
Thy liver ;
our youth, regardless of thy frown,
Their heads with sresher wreaths shall cro‘wffi
aad fij'ng thy wither'd garlands down
The river‘
