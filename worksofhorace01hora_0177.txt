enm, Boot< lv. 163

When morals fail, the stains of vice disgrace
'I'he fairest honoum, and the noblest raue.

k How much the grandem· of thy rising state
Owes to the Neroes, Rome imperial, say ;
⁷ XVitness Metaurus, and the dismal fate
Of vnaquish’d Asdrubal, and that glad day:
Which first auspicious, as the darkness fied,
O·er Latium·s face a tide os glory shed ;

Resistless in his rage, before that day

The Carthaginian with vindict'ffle ire
Through our fair cities urg‘d his eruel way,
εἷ’ As through the *pitehy pines destructive fire
Devours its course: or as when Eurus raves,
And howling rides the mad Sieilian πεῖθε.

The Roman youth, improving bysstheir toils,
With better fate now wield the vengeful ενι-(πᾶ,
Γ» And see those temples‚which were once the spoils
ἐφ’ Of Tyrian rapine, to their gods restor’d;
W'hen faithless Hannibal at length express'd
The boding sorrows of his anxious breast :

‘·' Like stags, of coward kind, the destin·d prey
Of ravening wolves, we unprovok‘d desy

z These, whom to baffle is our fairest play, “

μ’, The richest triumph we can boast, to fly.

Ι For mark that race, which to the Latian shore

” ''rhein-gods, their sons, their sires, intrepid bore.

 

” ’ - ⁴·' That tace, long tost upon the Tuscan
. waveS‚
Are like an oak upon the woody top

Of shaded Algidus, embrowwd with leaves,
⁷ Which, as keen axes its green honours lop,
'I'hrough wounds‚througl1losses no decay can feel 7
b Collecting strength and spirit from the steel, .
