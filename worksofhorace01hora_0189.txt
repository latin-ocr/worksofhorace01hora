ODE XII.
ΤΟ VlRGIL.

COMPANIONS of the Spring‚ the Thracian winds
With kindly breath now drive the bark from
No fro-ssggietzh hoary hand, the meadow binds,
Nor swoln with winter snow the torrents roar.

The swallow, hapless bird! now builds her nestl
And in eomplaining notes begins to sing,
That, withsevenge too cruelly possess,
Impious she punish'd an incestuous king.

Stretch·d on the springing grass the shepherd swain
His reedy pipe with rural music fills ς’

The god, who guards hiaeflock, approves the straiu

The god, who loves Arcadia's gloomy hius.

virgil, ’tis thine with noble youths to feast:
Yet, since the thirsty season calls sog· wine,

Would you a cup of generous Bacchus tastey
Bring you the odours, and a cask is thine.

Thy little box of spikenard shall produce
A mighty eask, that in the cellar lies ;

Rig with large hopes shall flow th’ inspiring juice,
Powetful to sooth our griefs, and mise our joys

If pleasures such as these can charm thy soal,
Bring the glad merchandise‚ with sweets replete ;
Nor empty-handed shall you touch the bowl,
Nor do I mean like wealthy folk to treat.

Think on the gloomy pile's funereal flames,
And be no more with sondid lucre blind;
nix a short folly with thy labour⁷d sehemes 2
’Tis joyous solly, that unbends the mind.
