ODE XII.
TO NEOBULE.

UNHAPPY the maidens forbidden to prove
The bumper' s full Joy, or the rapturas of love;
¹{Unhappy the girls, who are destin’ d to hear
The tedious rebukes of old uncles severe.

, Cytherea' s wing 'd son now bids thee resign

The toils ofMiner va, the spinster divine;

For now, Neobule with other desires

The brightness of Hebrus thy bosom mspires ;
When he rises with vigourfromTiber's rough waves.
where the oil ofhisslabours athletic he laves,
&Ake Bellerophon skilful to rein the fierce swod,
*At cuffs never conquer’d, nor out-stripp’d in speedl.
'And dextrous‚ with darts never flyiug in vain,

'ro wound the light stag bounding over the plain7
Or active and valiant the boar to surprise,

'²' Transfix’d with his spear, as in covert he lies.
