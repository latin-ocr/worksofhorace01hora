40 THE WORKS oF HORACE.

Swift from the rocks down soams the broken surge, ·

Calm are the winds, the driving clouds disperse,

And all the threatning waves, so will the gods,
Smooth sink upon the peaceful deep.

Here stops the song, doubtful whom next to praise,

Or Romulus, or Numa's peaceful reign,

The haughty ensigns of a Tarquin's throne,
Or Cato, glorious in his fall. ⁷

Grateful in higher tone the Muse shall sing

The fate of ReguluS, the Scaurian race,

And Paulus, 'midst the waste of Cannae's field.
How greatly prodigal of life!

Form'd by the hand of penury severe,

In dwellings suited to their small demesne,

Fabricius, Curius, and Camillus rose:
To ‹leeds of martial glory rose.

Marcellus, like a youthful tree, of growth

Insensible‚ high shoots his spreading fame,

And like the moon, the feebler fires among,
conspicuous shines the Julian star.

Saturnian Jove, parent and guardian god

Of human race, to thee the fates assign

The care of Caesar’s reign; to thine alone
Inferior let his empire risen

&Vhether the Parthian⁷s sormidable powers.

Or farthest India's oriental sons,

W ith suppliant pride beneath his triumph sall.
Wide o'er a willing world shall he

Contented reign, and to thy throne shall bend

Submissive. Thou in thy tremendous ear

Shalt shake Olympus' head, and atour groves
Poluted, hurl thy dreadful bolts.
