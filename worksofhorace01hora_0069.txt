ΤΟ HIS LYRE

ἶ {F with thee beneath the shade
; Many an idle air I play'd,

Now the Latian song, my Iyte,

With some immortal strain inspira,
Such as once Alcaeus sung.

who, fierce in war, thy music‘strung, ·
When he heard the battle roar,

OrZrnoor’d his sea-test vessel on the shore,

WVine and the Muses were his theme,
And Venus‚laughter-10ving dame,
With Cupid ever by her side, ⁷
And Lycus, form’d in beauty’s pride,
With his hair of jetty dye,
And the blacklustre of his eye.
Charming shell, Apollo'sllove‚
How grateful to the seasts of Jove}
Hear thy poet⁷s solemn prayer,
Thou semler of emh anxious care.
