210? THE WORKS OF HORACE

He had not Priam's heedless court}-
Dissolv’d in wine, and festa] spon,
With midnight art surpris’d;
But, bravely bold, of open force,
Had proudly scorn’d Minerva's horse.
And all its hoiy cheat despis’d ;

Then arm'd, alas ἒ with horrors dire,
wide-wasting with resistless ire,

Into the flames had thrown
Iustam, upon whose faltering tongue
Their words in formless accents hung.

Infants to light and life unknown}

But charm'd by beauty⁷s queen and thee:
“rhe sire of godq, with just decree
Assensmg shook the skies;
That Troy should change th’ imperial pean·
And. guided by a better fate,
Glorious in distant realrns should riso.

Oh ἱ 'may the god, who could inspire
With living sounds the Grecian lyre:
In Xanthus⁷ lueid stream
'Who jo‘ys to bathe his flowing hair,
'Now make the Latian muse his care,
And powerful guard her rising fame ’
