ODE IX.
To THALIARCHUS.

, BEHOLD Soracte’s airy height,

J See how it stands a heap of snow ;

'. Behold the winter’s hoary weight
Oppress the labourmg woods below 3

And, by the season⁷s icy hand

Congeal'd, the lazy rivers stand.

Now melt away the winter⁷s cold,
And larger pile the 'cheerful fire ;
Bring down the vintage four-year-old,

VVhose mellow'd heat can mirth inspire 2
Then to the guardian powers divine
careless the rest of life resign ε

For, when the warring winds arise,
And 0⁷er the fervid ocean sweep,

They speak--and lo! the tempest dies
On the smooth bosom of the deep ,-

Unshaken stands the aged grove,

And feels the providence of Jove.

T0·morrow with its cares despise,

And make the present hour your own,
Be swift to catch it as it flies,

And score it up ae clearly won ;
Nor let your youth disdain ιο prove
The joys os &ancing‘and of love.
