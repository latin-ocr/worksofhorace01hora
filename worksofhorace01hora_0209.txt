ΤΟ THE ROMAN PEOPLE.
WHITHER, oh ! whither, impious, do ye run Y

L, , Why is the sword unsheath⁷d ; the war begun Ῥ

Has then too little of the Latian blood

Been pour’d on earth, or mlx'd with Neptune’ss.
flood ’ἶ

Not that the Romans with avenging fleme

Might burn the rival of the Roman name,>

ιζ Οι· Erimus, yet unbroken to our war.

In chains should follow our triumphal car,
But that the Parthian should his vows enjoy7
And Rome, with impious hand, herselfdestroy
The rage of wolves and lions is confin'd;
They never prey but on a different kind.
Answer, Fromrmadness rise those horrors dire ,ἲ
Does angry fate, or gunt, your souls inspire?
Silent they stand; with stupid wonder gaze,
While the pale cheek their inward guilt betrays⁷
'Tis so-the Fates have cruelly deereed, ⁷

That Rome for ancient fratricide must bleed :
The brother's blood, which stain⁷d our rising wall-⁴

On his descendants, lond, for vengeance calls..
