5:14 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

With guardian care around us wast, -
And with successive glories crownvthe state.

Let earth her various sruitage yield,
Her living verdure spread,
And form, amid the waving field,
A sheafy crown sor Ceres' head ;
Fau genial showers‚ and o'er our fleecy care
May Jove indulgent breathehis purest air .'

Chorus of Youtlzs.

Phoebus, whose kindly bemns impert
Health and gladness to the beart,
While in its quiver lies the pestilentia] daris,
Thy youthful suppliants hear :

Chorus of Virgins.

Queen of the stars, who rul'st the night
In horned majesty os light,
Bend to thy virgins a propitious ear.

Chorus os Youths and Vir-gius.

Η, ye godskthe Roman state
Was form’d by your immortal power,
Or is, to change th’ imperial seat,
And other deities adore,
-Beneath your guidance the Dardanian host

..Pouffld fiorth their legions on the Tuscan-ooast ·
