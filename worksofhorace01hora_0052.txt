44 THE WORKS oF HORACE

Intrepid Teucer sweeps the field,
And Sthenelus, in battle skiss’d ς
Or skill⁷d to guide with steady rein,
And pour his chariot o⁷er the plain.
Undaunted Merion shalt thou feeh
While Diomed with furious smel,
In arms superior to his sire,
Burns after thee with martial fire.
As when a stag at distance spies
A prowling wolf, aghast he flies
Os pasture heedless; so shall you,
High-panting, fly when they pursue.
Not such the promises you made,
Which Helen's easy heart betray⁷d.
Achilles' fleet with short delay
Vengesul protracts the fatal day:
But when ten rolling years expire,
Thy Troy shall blaze in Grecian fire.
