’ Not such the crowd os light companions prove,
’Nor the false mistress os a wauton love, 4

Faithless who wait the2lowest dregs to drain,
‘Nor friendship⁷= equal yoke with strength sustain,

Propitious guard our Caesar, who explores
,His vent'rous way to sal-theat Britain's shores :
Our new-rais’d troops be thy peculiar care,
'SVho dreadful to the East ouss'banners bear.

' Alae! the shameless scats! the guilty deeds2
When by a brother's hand a brother bleeds1
What crimes have we, an iton age, not dar’d'?
ln terror of the gods what altar spa-r'd ’ἔ

Oh ! that our swords with civil gore distain’o‘i
And in the sight of gods ond men profanu—
Sharpen again, dread queen, the blunted steel,
And iet our roes the pointed vengeance feel.
