ὡς THE woRKs OF nomem.

“ Not Hydra stronger‚ when dismembere, rose
'Against Alcmena's much-enduring son,
Grieving to find, from his repeated blows,
The soe redoubled, and his toil begun ;
Nor Colchis teem·d, nor Echionian Thebes
A, fellet monster from their bursting glebes.

ὅ ” In ocean plunge them, they emerge more bright ¹.

At arms oppose them in the dusty field,
With routed squadrons they renew the fight,
And soree your yet unbroken troops to yield,
And battles wage, to be the future boast
Of their proud consorts o'er our vanquis⁷d host.

‘³⁴ To los ty Carthage I no more shall send

Vaunts of my deeds, and heralds of·my famem„

My boundless hopes, alas {gare at an end,
With all the flowing fortune of our name z
These boundless hopes, that flowing fortune, al}
Are dashd, and buried in my brossler's falle·

The Claudian race, those savourites of the skies

No toil shall damp, no fortitude withstand13
Superior they to difficulties rise,
XVhom Jove proteets with an indulgent hand 3
‘zu‘hom cautious cares, preventing'f'wiles afar,
&uide through the perils of tumultuous war„

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

PROPITIOUS to the sons of Earth
(Best guardian of the Roman state)

The heavenly powers beheld thy birth,
And form'd thee glori-sus, good and great ,
