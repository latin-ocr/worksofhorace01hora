 

ODES, BOOK 11,

Far fleeter than the timorous hind,

Far fleeter than the driving wind„

The spirit that, serenely gay,

Careless enjoys the present day,

· Can with an easy, cheerful smne

t The bitterness of life beguile;

5 Nor fears the approaehing bour of · fam-7

· Nor hopes for human bliss complete.
Achilles perish’d in his prime,

’Pithon was worn away by time,

And Fate, with lavish hand, to me

May grant what it denies to thee.

A hundred bleat'ing flocks are thiae,-

Around thee graze thy lowing kine3

Neighing thy mares invite the reins,

Thy robes the twice-dy’d purple stains .

On me not unindulgent Fate

Bestow’d a tul-al, calm ibetreat,

When-e 1 may tune the Roman lyre,

And warm the song with Grecian fire ,-

‘rhen scorn, in conscious virtue proud,

The worthless malice of the> crum}
