ODE XXXVI.

WITH incense heap the sacred fire4
And bolder strike the willing lyre.
'Now let the heifer's votive blood ·
Pour to the gods its purple flood:

rhose guardian gods, from sarthest Spain
'Who send our Numidaagain.

A thousand kisses now he gives,
A thousand kisses he receives.
But Lamia most his friendship proves,
Lamia with tenderness he loves.
At school their youthful love began,
Whence they together rose to man.

With happiest marks the day shall shin3
Nor want th' abundant· Joy os wine:

<Like Salian priests the dance we 'll lead,
And many a mazy measure tread.
Now let the Thracian goblet foain,
Nor in the breathlcss draught o⁷ercome
Shall Bassus yield his boasted name
To 'Damalis of tipling fame.

Here let the rose and lily shed
The‘n· short-liv⁷d bloom ; let parsley spi-ear}
Its living vex-dure o'er the feast,
And crown with mingled sweets the guest,
On Damalis each amorous boy
Shall gaze with eyes that flow with joy,
While she 7 as curls the ivy-plam,
Shall twine luxui-tant round her new gallam..
