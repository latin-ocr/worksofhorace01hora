⁴36 THE yvoRKs or Homo&

ODE XVI.
TO POMPEIUS GROSPHU&

CAUGHT in the wild AEgaean sene,
'I'he sailor bends to heaven for ease,
While clouds the moon's fair lustre hid'e,
And not a star his course to guide.
Furious in war the Thracian prays,
'she quiver’d Mede, sor ease, for ease Δ.
A bleseing never to be sold
For gemS, for purple, or sor gold,

N or can the consul’s power controul
The sickly tumults of the soul,
Or bid the cares to stand aluos
That hover round the vaulted roos ’ἲ

Happy the man whose srugal boam}
His father's plenty can afford ι
His gentle sleep nor anxious sear
shall drive away, nor sordid care.

Why do we aim with eager sta-ise
At things beyond the mark os life 2
To elimatos warm'd by other suns

‘In vain the wretched exile runs ;

Plias from his country⁷s native skies,
But never from himself he flies;
‹Jorroding cares incessant charge

uis ssight, *and climb his armed bau-ge,
Or though he mount the rapid steed t
Pare soflows with unerring speed32
