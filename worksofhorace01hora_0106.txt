{24 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

For all must see Cocytus flow,
those gloomy water sadly stow,
Strays through the dreary soil.
The guilty maids, an ill-fam⁷d train !
And, Sisyphus, thy labours vain,
Condemn'd to endless toil.

Your pleasing consort must be lest,
And you, of villas, lands, bereft,
M ust to the shades descend:
The cypress only, hated tree!
Os all thy much-lov⁷d groves, shall thee,
Its short—liv' d lord , attend.

Then shall your worthier heir discharge
And set th> imprison'd easks at large,
And dye the floor with wine,
So rich and precium, not the feasts
OT holy pontifss cheer their guests
W {th liquor more divine.-
