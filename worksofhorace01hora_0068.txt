‘ro Apono,

WHEN at Apollo's hallow’d shrine

The poet hails the power divine,
And here his first libatione poure,
Syhat is the blessing he implores ’ἔ
¹He nor desires tho swessing grain,
That yellows o’er Sardinia’s plain:
Nor the sair herds, that lowing seed ·
O'n warm Calabria's flowery mead ;
Nor ivory, of spotless shine ;
Nor gold, forth-flaming from its mine τ
Nor the rich fields that Liris laves,
And eats away with silent waves.

Let others quaff the racy wine
To whom kind Fortune gives the vine ς
The golden goblet let him drain
Who vent⁷rous ploughs th’ Atlantic mffinss.
Blest with three sare returns a-year,
For he to every god is dear.

To me boon Nature frankly yields
Her wholesome eallad from the fields ;
Nor ask I more, than sense and hea1th
Suu to enjoy my present wealth.
Erom age and all its weakness free,

Ο son of Jove, preserv’d by thee,
Gffive me to strike the tuneful lyre,

And thoy my latest song inspire(2
