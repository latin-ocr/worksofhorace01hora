nte ' THE wonxs OF. HoRAcE.
Thy chaste example quens the spotted (leed-
And to the guilt thy punishmentq suceeed.

who shall the faithless Parthian dread,
The freezing arm'ies of the north,
The enormous youth, to battle brad,
thom horrid Germany brings forth ’.Ρ
who shall regard the war of cruel Spain,
Is Caesar live secure, is Caesar reign?

Safe in his vineyard toils the hind,
W'eds to the widow⁷d elm his vine,
Till the sun sets his hill behind,
Then hastens joyful to his wine,
&nd in his gayer hours of mirth implores
'shy godhead to protect and bless his stores

To thee he chants the sacred song,
To thee the rich libation pours ;
Thee, plac'd his household gods among.
With solemn, daily prayer adores :
ἕο Castor and great Hercules of old
W'ere with her gods by grateful Greece entoll'da

Graeious and good,beneath thy reign
May Rome her happy hours employ5 ¹ ι
And grateful hail thyjust domain ’
With pious hymns and festal joy ε
Thus, with the rising sun we sober pray,
Thus in our wine beneath his setting ray.
