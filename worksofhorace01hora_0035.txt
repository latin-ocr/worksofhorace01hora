ODE 111.

TO THE SHIP ΪΝ WHICH VIRGIL SAILED
ΤΟ ATHENS.

SO may the Cyprian queen divine
And the twin-stars with saiing lustre shine ς
So may the father of the wind
All others, but the western breezes, bind,
As yousdear vessel, safe restore
· Th’ entrusted pledge to th’ Athenian shore,
And of my sou] the partner save,
My much-lov⁷d virgil, from the raging wave.
Or oak‚ or brass‚ with triple sold,
Around that daring mortavs bosom roll’d,
Who first to the wild ocean’s rege
Launch’d the frail berk, and heard the wind's en-
gage
Tempestubus, when the South descensis
Precipitate‚ and with the North contende ;
Nor fear'd the srars portending rain,
Nor the loud tyrant of the western main,
Os power supreme the storm to saise,
Or calmet smooth the surface of the seas.
What various forms of death could fright
The man, who view'd with fix’d, unshaken sight,
The floating monsters‚ waves inflam’d,
And rocks sor shipwreck⁷d fieets ill-farn'd?
Jove has the reaims of earth in vain
vivided by th⁷ inhabitable main,
Is ships profane, with fem-less pride,
Bound o⁷er t‘h’ inviolable tide.
