ODES, BOOK Ι. 41

ODE XIII.
TO LYDIA.

ΑΗ Ε when on Telephus his charms,
· When on his rosy neck and waxen arms,
r Lydia with ceaseless rapturo dwells,
j With jealous spleen my glowing bosom swells,
My reason in confusion flies,
And on my cheek th' uncertain colour dies,
While the down-stealing tear betrays.
The lingering flame, that on my vitals preys.
I burn, when in excess of wine,
Brutal, he soils those snowy arms of thiae,
Or on thy lips the fier‘ce-fond boy
ἱ Impresses with his tecth the furious joy.
Ifyetimy voice can reach your ear,
Hope not to find him constant and sincere}
Cruel who hurts the fragrant kiss, ,
Which Venus hathes with quintessence of bliss.
” Thrice happy they, whom love unites
In equal rapture, and sincere delights,
Unbroken by complaints or strise,
· Even to the latest hours of life.
