52 THE WORKS OF HORAGE.

With death's etei-nal sleep opprest!
oh! when shall nith, of soul sincere,
Os Justice pure the sister sair,

And Modesty‚ unspotted maid,

And Truth in artless guise array'd,
Among the tace of human kind

An equal to Quintilius find Ἰ

How did the good, the virtuous mcum,-

And pour their sorrows o'er his um!
But, Virgil, thine the loudest strain.
Yet all thy pious grief is³vain ;

In vain do you the gods implore

Thy lov⁷d Quintilius to restore,
VVhom on sar other terms they gave,
' By nature fated to the grave.

What though you can the lyre commane}-

And sweep its tones with Soster hand
Thau Orpheus, whose harmonicus song
Once drew the listening trees along,
Yet ne'er returns the vital heat

The shadowy form to animate 2

For when the ghost-eompelling god
Formsliis blank troops with horrid r0d3
He will not, lenient to the breath

Of prayer, unbar the gates of death..
“Tis hard ε but patience must endum
'md south the woes it cannot curo.
