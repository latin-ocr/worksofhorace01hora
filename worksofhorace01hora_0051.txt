ODE XV.

THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS.

WHEN the perfidious shepherd bore

1 The Spartan dame to Asia’s shore,

; Nereus the rapid winds oppress'd,

- And calm'd them to unwilling rest,

That he might sing the dreadful fate

Which should their guilty loves await. ,
Fatal to Priam's ancient sway

You bear th’ ill-omen'd fair away:

For soon shall Greece in arms arise,

Deep-flworn to break thy nuptial ties.

what toils do men and horse sustain ἔ

what carnage loads the Dardan plaint

Pallas prepares the bounding car,

The shield and belm and rage of war.

Though proud ofVenus' guardian care,

In vain you eomb your flowinghair ;

In vain you sweep th' unwarlike string,

And tender airs to females sing ;

,For though the dart may harmless prove

(The dart that frights the bed of love ς)

Though you escape- the noise of fight,

Nor Ajax can o'ertake thy ssight ;

Yet shalt thou, infamous of lust,

soil those adu-herous hairs in dusr.
Look back and see, with furious pace.

That ruin os the Trojan race,

Ulysses drivesjrand sage in years

Fam’d Nestor, hoary chief} appears.
