ODE VII.

ΤΟ MUNATIUS PLANCUS.

LET other poets in harmonious lays
Immortal Rhodes or Mitylene praise,
Or Ephesus, or Corinth’s towery pride,
Girt by the rolling main on either side ;
Or Thebes, or Delphos, for their gods renown'd‚
Or Tempe⁷s plains with flowery honours erown’d.
There are, who sing in everlasting strains
The towers where wisd0m⁷s virgin-goddess teigne.
And ceaseless toiling court the trite reward
of olive, pluck'd by every vulgar bar-d.
For Juno’s fame, th' unnumber'd tuneful throng
With rich Mycenae grace their favour-ite song,
And Α rgos mast, of pregnant glebe to seed
The warlike horse, and animate the breed ι
But me, nor patient Lacedaemon charms,
Nor sair Larissawith such transport warnis,
As pure Albunea's far—resounding source,
And rapid Anio, headlong in his course,
Or Tibur, fene 'd by groves from soler beems,
And fruitfulorchards bath' d by ductile streams.
:⁴⁴ ÷÷ ξῆξῆξῆξῆ ᾗ ἢ
The south wind often, when the welkin lowers,
Sweeps off the clouds, nor teems perpetual shower Ξ
So,P1ancus‚ be the nappy wisdom thiae,
To end the cares of life in mellow'd wine 3
XVhether the camp with banners bright display'd.
Or Tibur hold thee in its thick-wrought shade.
When Teucer from his sire and country fied,
