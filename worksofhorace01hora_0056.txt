48 THE woRK's or· HORACE.

ODE XIX.
ΟΝ GLYCERA .

V ENUS , who gave the Cupide birth,
And the resistless god of wine,
With the gay power of wauton mirth,
Now bid my heart its peace resign ;
Again for Glycera I burn,
And all my long-forgotten flames return.

Like Parian marble pure and bright‚
The shining maid my bosom warme:
Her face, too dazzling for the sight,

Her sweet coquetting—how it charms t
whole Venus rushing through my veins,

No longer in her favourite Cyprus reigns;

No longer suffers me to write
Of Scythians, fierce in martial deed,
Or Parthian, urging in his ssight
The battle with reverted steed:
Such themes she will no more approve,
Nor aught that sounds impertinent to love.

Here let the living altar rise
Adorn'd with every herb and flower ;

’ Here flame the incense to the skies‚
And purest wine's libation pour;
Due honours to the goddess paid, ,

302st siuks to willing love the yielding maid.
