THE

SEC ULAR POEM.

...4—

lee Poet to the People.

&TAND off, ye vulgar, nor profane,
With bold, unhallow⁷d sounds, this festal scens*
ln hymns inspir'd by truth divine,
I, priest to the melodious Nine,

’1¹0 youths and virgins sing the mystie strain

To the Chorus os Youths and Virgim.

PHOEBUS taught me how to sing,
How to tune the vocal string ;
Phoebus made me known to Fame,
Honour'd with a poet's name.

Noble youths, and virgins sair,
Chaste Diana's guardian care
(Goddess. whose unerring dart
Stops the lynx, or flying hart,)

Mark the Lesbian measures well,

XVhere they fall, and where they swell ,
And in varied cadence sing,
As Ι strike the changing sti-ing.

To the god,-who gilds the skies,
Let the solemn numbers rise3
Solemn sing the-queen of night,
And her crescent's bending light,
Which adown the fruitful year

ἱ
ᾗ Reus the months in prone career.
