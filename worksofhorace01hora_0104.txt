:92 THE WORKS OF HORACE„

Alcaeus bolder sweeps the stringe,

And seas, and war, and exile sings ’.Ρ
Thus while they strike the various ly τις,

“Ehe ghosts the sacred sounds admire;

But when Alcaeus tunes the strain

To deeds of war, and tyrants slain,

In thicker crowds the shadowy throng

Drink deeper down the martial song.

W⁷hat wonder ’.ἱ when with heading eal-,S

The dog· of hell &stonish'd hears,

And, in the Furies’ hair entwin⁷d‚

*vhe snakes with cheerful horror wind ;

While, oharm'd by the melodicus strainsf„

The tortur’d ghosts forget their pains,

Orion quits his bold delight, ·

ΤΟ chase the lion's tage, or lynx's 115,ng
