ARCHYTAS, wffat avails thy nice survey
Ofocean⁷s countless sands, of earth and sea ’ζ’
In vain thy mighty spirit once conld soar

Το orbs celestial, and their course explore ς

You lie eonfin’d, till some more liberal hand
shall strow the pinus dust in funeral rite,

And wing thee to the boundless realms of light.

Even he, who did with gods the banquet share*
Tithonos, rais³d to breathe celestia] air, ’
And Minos, J ove⁷s own eounsellor ofstate,

All these have yielded to the power of fate.

Mariner.

Even your own sage, whose monumenta] shielti,>
Borne through the terrors of the Trojan field,
Prov'd that alone the mouldering body dies,

And souis immortal from our ashes rise,
Even he a second time resign’d hi? bream,
Sem*² headlong to the gloomy realmss of death ε

Glzost.
Not meanly skill’d, even by your own applansn.
{n moral nuth, and nature’s secret Iaws.
One endless night sor all mankind remains,
And once we au must tread the shadowy piains.
