ODE XIII(

ΤΟ A FRIENDe

SEE· what horrid tempests risse,
fxnd contraet the elouded skies ;
Snows and showers fill the air,

And bring down the atmosphere.
Hark ! what tempests sweep the floods !
How they shake the rattling woods!

Let us while ivs in our power,
Let us seize the fleeting hour:
While our- cheeks are fresh and gay,
Let us drive old age away3
Let us smooth its gether'd brows‚
Youth its hour of mirth allows.

Bring us down the 'mellow'd wine,
Rich with years, that equal mine ;
Prithee‚ talkno more of sorrow,

To the gods belongs to-morrow‚
And, perhaps, with gracious power
They may change the gloomy hour.
Let the richest essence shed
Eastern odours on your head,
While the soft Cyllenian lyre
Shall your labouring breast inspira.
To his pupil, brave and young,
Thus the noble Centaur sung:
Matchless mortal! though 'tis thiae.
Proud to boast a birth divine,
