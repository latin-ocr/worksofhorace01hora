The gaudy guest, of impious fame,
No more enjoys th' adulterous dame ;
, Hectot no more his faithless brothers leads
, Το break the Greeian force; no more the victor

bleeds.

    
  
   

Since the long war now sinks to peace..
And all our heavenly factiuns cease ς ’
Instant to Mars my vengeance 1 resign,
And here receive his son, though born of Trojau
line.

Here, with eneireling glories bright‚
Free let him tread the pathe of light,
' And, rank’d among the tranquil powers divine.
Drink deep the nectar'd bowl, and quaff celestiai
wme.

From Rome to Troy's detested shores,
While loud a length of ocean roars,
Unenvied let th’ illustrious exiles reign,
evhere Fate directs their course, and spreaxls theit-
wide domain.

On Priam's and th' adulterer’s urn

While herds the dust insulting flpurn7
Let the proud Capitol in glory stand,
‚- And Rome, to triumph'd Medea, give forth he.-
stem command z

Let the victorious voice of Fame
wide spread the terrors of her name,
Where fleas the continents of earth divide,

ζ ² *md Nilus bathes the plain with h'is prolific lits!
