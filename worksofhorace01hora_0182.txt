168 THE WORKS oF HORACEX }

Nor chaste Diana from infernal night
2Could bring her modest favouriteffiack to light j

And hell-descending Theseus strove in vain

'ro break his amorous friend‘s Lethaean chain.

ODE vm.
ΤΟ CENSORINUS.

W ITH liberal heart to every friend
A bowl or caldron would 1 sende:
Or tripods, which the Greeians gave,
As rich rewards to heroes brave ;
Nor should the meanest gift be thino:
If the rich works of art were mine,
By Scopas or Parrhasius wrought‚
With animating skill who taught
The shapeless stone with ‘lise to glow,
Or bad the breathing eolours ssow,
To imitate, in every line,
The form or human or divine.

But Ι nor boast the curious stote,
And you nor want, nor wish sor moreg
fris yours the joys of verse to know,

Such joys as Horace ean bestOW,
While I can voueh my present’s worth
And ca-ll its every virtue south.
