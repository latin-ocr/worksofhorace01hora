{302 THE WoR-KS OF HORACE'.

But let us swear, when floating rocks shall gain.
Rais'd from the deep, the sut-face of the main 4
XVhen lowiy Po the mountain-summit laves,
And Apennine shall plunge beneath the waves ;
When nature⁷s monsters meet in strange delighp.
And the fell tigress shall with stags unite;
'When the fieroe kite shall woo the willing dove,
And win the wauton with adulterous love ;
When herds on brindled lions fearless gaze,
And the smooth goat exults in briny seas:
Then, and then only, to the tempting gale
To spread repentant the retur-ningsail.

Yet to cut off our hopes, those hopes that chal-m
Our fondness horne, let us with curses arm
These high resolves. Thus let the brai-e and ivise.
whose souls above th' indocile vulgar rise;
Then let the erow'd, who dare not hope success7
Inglorious, these ill-omen'd seats possess

But ye, whom virtue warms, indulge no more
These female plaints, but quit this sared shore 3
For earth-s-urrounding sea our ssight awahs,
Offering its blissful isles, and happy seats,
VVhere annual Ceres erowns th⁷uncultur'd field,
And vines unprun'd their blushing clusters yield ; .
where olives, faithful to their season, grow,
And figs with nature’s deepest purple glow ;
From hollow oaks where honey’d streams distin
And bounds with noisy foot> the pebbled rill ;
*Where goats untaught forsake the flowery vale⁷
And bring their swelling udders to the pail ;
Nor evening bears the sheep—sold growl amand:
Nor mining vipers heave the tainted ground·
Nor watry Eurus deluges the plain,
Nor hears exeess ive burn the springing grain..
