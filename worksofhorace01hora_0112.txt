100⁵* THE wonxs or nomon

om: xum.

No walls, with ivery ialam,
Adorn my house ; no colonnade
Proudly supports my eitron beamss,
Nor rich with gold my ceiling flames ς
Nor have I, like an heir unknown,
Seiz'd upon Attalus his throne ;
Nor dames, to happier fortunes bred,
Draw down for me the purple thread ι
Yet with a firm and honest beart,
Unknowing or of fraud or art,

A liberal vein os genius Uest,
I⁷m by the rich and great ean-est.

My patron's gift, my Sabine field
shall au its rural plenty yield,
And, happy in that rural stote,
Of heaven and him Ι usk no more.
Day presses on the heels of day,
And moons increase to their decay:
But you, with thoughtless pride elate!
‘Unconsqious of impending fate,
command the pinax-'d dome to rise,
When lo! thy tomb forgotten lies,
And, though the Waves indignant rear,
Forward you urge the Baian shore,
While earth’s too narrow bounds in vain
Your guilty p-rogress would nestram.-
’Σὴθ sacred landmark strives in vain
Your impious avariae to mestraim
