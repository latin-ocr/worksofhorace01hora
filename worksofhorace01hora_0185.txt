ODES, BOOK I'V. 171

No'r first from Teucer's ven geful bow
The seather⁷d death unerring ssew,
Nor was the Greek the single foe
NVhose tage ill-fated Ilion knew
Greece had with heroes fill'd th⁷ embattled plain,
lVorthy the Muse in her sublimest strain.

Nor Hector first transported heard
With fierce delight the war's alarms,
Nor brave Deiphobus appear'd
Amid the tentend field in arms,
With glorious ardour prodigal of lise,
To guard a darling son and faithful wife.

Before great Agamemnon reign'd,
Reign'd kings as great as he, and brave.
those huge ambition's now contain⁷d
In the small compass of a grave ;
Ia endless night they sheep, unwept, unknown,
No bard had they to make all time their own.

ln earth if it forgotten lies,

What is the valour of the brave Τ
What difference, when the eoward dies,
And siukis in silence to his grave 'I
Nor, Lollius, will I not thy praise proclaim,

But from oblivion vindicate thy fame.

Nor shall its livid power conceal
Thy toils-how glorious to the state!
How constant to the public weal
'through all the doubtful turns of fate ἕ
Thy eteady soul, by long experience found
Erect aliRe, when Fertune smil‘d or frown'd.
