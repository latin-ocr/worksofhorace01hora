ODE XXIV.

AGAINST MisERs

THOUGH of rh⁷unrifled gofd possest
Of gorgeous Iud, andrrAraby the blest;
Though with hewn, massy rocks you raise

Y our haughty structures midst th' indignant sea:

Y,et soon as Fate shall round your head.
With adamantine strength, its terrers spread,
Nor the dictator' s power shall save

Your soul from fear, your body from the gravet

Happy the Scythians, houseless train !

Who rou their vagrant dwellings o’er the plah: ·

Happy the Getes fierce and brave,

Vffhom no fix'd laws os property enslave;
While open stands the golden grain,

'she free-born fruitage of th’unbounded plain-
Suceeeding yearly to the toil,

They plough with equal tasks the public soii⁴
Not there the guiltless step-dame knows
The baleful draugnt for orphans to compo-:se τ
No wife high-portiorz’d rules her sponse:
Or trusts her essenced lover’s saithhess-vows

Tho lovers there sor dowry claim
'she father’s virtue and the mother's same<

That dares not break the nuptia] tie,
I'ol'zuted crime ! whose portion is to dio.

O that some patriot, wise and good,
would stop this impious thirst of civil blood,

And joy on statues to behold

llis name, the Father of the State, e :wne ·'} (1
