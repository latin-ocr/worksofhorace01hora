 

ODES, BOOK 111.

High though his structures rise in air, ·

Pale menaea, and black despair,
This haughtylord shall find

O’ertake his armed galley's speed,

' And when he mounts the flying steed7

,ἶ Sits gloomy Caro behind.

ἶ If purple, which the morn outshines,

ΟΣ marble from the Phrygian mines,
Though labour'd high with art,

If essence, breathing sweets divine,

Or flowing howls of generous wine,
111 sooth anzanxious heart.

On columns, rais’d in modern style,
Why should 1 plan the lofty pile
To rise with envied state ;
why, sor a vain, superfluous stote,
Which would eneumber me the more>
Resign my Sabine seat Τ.
