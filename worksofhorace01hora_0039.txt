ODE VI. .

ΤΟ AGRIPPA.

VARIUS, who soars on Homer's πίῃς.
Agl-lppa, shall thy conquests sing,
Whate⁷er‚ inspired by his command,

The soldier dar’d on sea or land.

But we nor tempt with seeble art

Achilles' unrelenting heart,
Nor sage Ulysses in our lays

Pursues his wanderings through the sens 2

Nor ours in tragic stt-ains to tell
How Pe1ops⁷ cruel offspring fell.

The Muse, whorules th' unwarlike lyre.

Forbids me boldly to aspire
To thine or sacred Caesar's same,
And hurt with feeble song the theme.
who can describe the god of fight
In adamantine armour bright;
Or Marion on the Trojan shore
With dust, how glorious Ξ cover'd o’er ;
Or Diomed, by Pallas' hid,
To warring gods an equal made?
But whether loving, whether free,
With all our usual levity,
Untaught to strike the martial string,
Os feasts and virgin fights we sing ς
Of maids, who, when bold love assails,
Fierce in their anger-pare their nails.
