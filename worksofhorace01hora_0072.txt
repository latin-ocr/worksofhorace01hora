ODE XXXV.

To FORTUN E.

’ GODDESS, whom Antium, beauteous town¹⁷
whosg‘ffiffgus will with instant power can mise
Erail mortals from the depths os low despair,

Or change proud triumphs to the funeral tear :

Thee the poor farma, who with ceaseless pain
‘Labours the glebe3 thee, mistress of the main,
The sailor, who with fearless spirit dares
'I'he rising tempest, courts with anxious prayers ¹.

Thee the rough Dacian,thee the vagrant band
01⁶ field-born Scythians, Latium's warlike land,
Cities and natione, mother-queens revere,

And purple tyranny beholds with sear.

Nor in thy rage with foot destructive spurn
This standing pillar, and its strength 0’erturn3
Nor let the nations rise in' bold uproar,

And civil war, to break th⁷ imperial power.

With solemn pace and firm, in awful state
,Before thee stalks inexorable Faue,
And grasps empaling nails, and wedges dread:
The hook tormentous, and the melted lead :

Thee Hope and Honour‚ now, alas, how rare ἔ
With white enrob'd, attend with duteous care,
When from the palaee of the Great you fly
ἵει angry moed, and guib os mizery,
