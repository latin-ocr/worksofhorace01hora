ODE XI.
ΤΟ ΜἘἘΕΙῙΒΥ-ο

,· Ο THOU, by whose harmonicus aid
J* Amphion's voice the listening stones could lead ·.
’; And sweetest shell of power to raise,
On seven melodious strings‚ thy various 1ays;
- Not vocal, when you first were found,
· But of a simple and ungrateful sound; ’
Now tun’d so sweetly to the ear,
That gods and men with sacred rapture hear 3
Oh ! thou inspire the melting strain
To charm my Lyde’s obstinate disdain,
Ἀ Who like a filly o'er the field
Twith playful spirit bounds, and fears to yield
' γ To hand of gentlest touch70rr prove,
Wild as she is, the joys ofwedded love.
„¹ ’Tis yours, with all their beasts of prey,
ΙξΤο bid the forests move, and powersul stay
The rapid stream. The dog of hell,
Immense of bulk, to thee soft-soothing fell,

And suppliant bow’d, though round his head

 

His hundred snakes their guardian horrors spread

a« Baleful his breath though fiery glow'd,

And from his three-tongued jaws fell poison flow'd.
Ixion, of his pains beguil'd,

*And Tityos, with unwilling pleasure, smil’d 3

, ⁷ Dry stood their urn, while with soft strain
ou sooth⁷d the labours of the virgin train.
Let Lyde hear, what paine, decreed,

Though late, iu death attend the direful deed.
