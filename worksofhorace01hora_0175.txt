ODES‚ BOOK IV. 5?ssss

And taming haughty monarchs’ pride,
With laurel'd brows conspicuous sar,
To Jove’s Tarpeiam temple ride :
But hirn, the streams which warbling flow
Rich Tiber's fertile vales along,
And shady groves, his haunts, shall know
The master of 111⁷ AEolian song.
The sons of Rome, majestic Rome ἱ
Have placed me in the poet's quire,
And Envy, now or dead or dumb,
Forbears to blame what they admite,
Goddess of the sweet-sounding lute,
Which thy harmonious touch obeys,
Who canst the finny race, though mute?
To cygnet's dying accents raise,
Thy g'ist it is, that all, with ease,
⁴ Me prinae os Roman lyrics own:
3 That, while 1 live, my numbers please,
ἑ Is pleasing, is thy gift alone.
