ἃ ODES, BOOK lv. 179
Ξ So branching Assfidus, who laves'

ft· The Daunian realms, fierce rolls his wavefl,

J WVhen to the golden labours of the swain
&meditatos his wraffl, and deluges the plain,

'.‘ As Claudius, with impetuous might,
ζ» Broke‘ through the iton ranks of fight ;
’ξ From front to rear the bloodiess victor sped,

ffow’d down th' embattled field, and wide the
slaughter spread.

    
    
   

ᾗ Thine were his troops, his counsels thino,
2, And all his guardian powers divine ε

For, since the day when Alexandria's port
Dpen'd, in suppliahoe low, her desolated court:

j &Vhen thrioe five times the circling sun
⁸ His annual course of light had run;
·; Fortune by this success hath crown'd thy name,
{onfirm'd thy glories past, and raisffd thy suture‘
' fame.
Dread guardian of th’ imperial state,
VVhose presence rules thy country’s fate,
On whom the Medos with awful wonder gaze,
Vhom unhous'd Scythians sear, unconquer’d Spain
obeys :
’ The Nile, who hides his sevenfold source,
The Tigris, headlong in his course,
The Danube, and the ocean wild that roars
sith monster-bearing waves round Britain's rocky
shores : ff

The fea‘rless Gaul thy name reveres,

Thy voice the rough lberian hears,
with arms eompos’d the fierce Sicambrians yie1d.
»r view, with dear delight‚ the carnage of the field.
