ODE IX.

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN nomon ΛΝΒ
LYmA.

Horace.

WHILE 1 was pleasing to your arms,
Nor any youth, of happier charms,
Thy snowy bosom blissful press'd,

Not Persia’s king like me was blest.
Lydia.
While for no other sair vou butp'd,
Nor Lydia was for Chloe scornd,
What maid was then so blest as thine ’ἒ
Not Ilia's fame could equal mine.
Horace.
Now Chloe reigns; her voice and lyre
Melt down the soul to soft desire;'
Nor will I sear even death, to save
Her dearer beauties from the grave.
., Lydia.
My heart young Calais inspires,
whose bosom glows with mutual fires,
For whom I twice would die with joy,
If death would spate the charming,b0y.
Horace.
Yet what is Love, whose hands we broke,
Again should tame us to the yoke;
Should 1 shake off bright Chloe's chain,

And take my Lydia home again?
