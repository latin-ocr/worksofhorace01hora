GENTLE eask of mellow wine,

And os equal age with mine 3

Whether you to broile or mirth⁷

Or to maddingffove give birth ;

Or the toper's tempels steep

Sweetly in ambrosia] sleep ;

For whatever various use

You preserve the chosen juice,

Worthy of some festa} hour,

Now the hoary vintage pour :

Come—Corvinus, guest divine,

Bids me draw the smoothest wine.
Though with science deep imbued.

He, not like a Cynic rude,

Thee despises ‚ sor of old

Cato⁷s virtue, we are told,

Osten with a bumper glow’d,

And with social raptures flow'd. “
You by gentle tortures oft

Melt hard tempers into sost ;

You strip off the grave disguise

From the counsels of the wise,

And with Bacchus, blithe and gay,

Bring them to the face of day.

ssope by thee, fair fugi‘five ! ·

Bids the wretched strive to live ;

To the beggar you dispensa
