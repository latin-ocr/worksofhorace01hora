§8 THE WORKS OF HORACF..

So Caesar through the billows press’d
'1¹9 lead in chains the fatal pest ,z v
But she a nobler sate exp10r⁷d, K

Nor woman-like beheld the deathful sword.

Nor with hin· navy fied dismay’d,

In distant realms to seek for aid,

But saw unmov'd her-‘state destroy⁷d,
Her palace desolate, a‘lonely void ε

With fearless hand she dar⁷d to grasp

The writhings of the wrathful asp,

And suck the poison through her veins,
Resolv'd on death, and fiercer from its pains

Thon scorning to be led the boast

Of mighty Caesar’s naval host, ,

And arm’d with more than morta] spleen.
Desrauds a triumph, and expires a queen ·
