ODES, BOOK m. 149

ODE XXVI.
ΤΟ VENUS

.- 1 LATELY was fit to ber call'd upon nimy,
‚- And gallantly fought in the service of beauty t

< But now crown’d with conquest I hang up my arms 5

My harp, that campaign'd it in midnight alarms z
Here fix on this wall, here my ensigns of ware,
By the statue of Venus, my torehes and bars,
And arrows, which threaten'd, hy Cupid their nege
Usar, war on all doors that dare hold out a siege.
Ο goddess of Cyprus, and Memphis that know
Nor the coldness or weight of love-chilling snow-
With a high-lifted stroke, yet gently severe?
Avenge me on Chloe, the proud and the fair.

ODE XXVII.
ΤΟ GALATEA.

FIERCE from her cubs the ravening sox
Or wolf from steep -Lanuviau rocks,
Or pregnant biteh, or chattering jay,

Ill-omeffld, guide the wieked on their way ,ῑ

Ξςΐρεηῐε, like arrows, sidelong thwart·
‘ The road, and make their horses start.
For those 1 love, with anxious sear
Ι. view the doubtful skies, a prudent seer„
