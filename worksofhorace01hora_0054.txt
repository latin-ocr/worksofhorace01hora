ODE XVII.

TO TYNDARIS.

PAN from Arcadia's hius descende
Το visit oft my Sabine seat,
And hore my tender goats defends
From rainy winde, and summer's fiery beat ;

For when the vales, wide-spreading round,
The sloping hills, and polish'd rocks

With his harmonious pipe resound,
In searless safety graze my wandering flockn* 2

In safety, through the woody brake,

The latent shrubs and thyme explore,
Nor longer dread the speekled snake,

And tremble at the martial wolf no more.

'l'heir poet to the gods is dear,
They love his piety and muse,
And all our rural honours here
Their flow’ry wealth around thee shall diffuse.

Here shall you tune Anacreon’s lyre,
Beneath a shady mountain’s brow‚
To sing frail Circe's guilty fire,
And chaste Penelope⁷s unbroken vow.

F ar from the burning dog-star's ruge

Here shall you quaff our harmless wine 2,
Nor here shall Mars intemperate wage

Rude war with him who rules the jovial vine 2

Nor Cyrus’ bold suspicions sear:
Not on thy sotfness shall he lay

His desperate hand, thy clothes to te'nr,
Or brutal snatch thy sestal crown away.
