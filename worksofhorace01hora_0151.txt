'¹‘ QDEs, BOOK 111. 13:l
And to th' unwishing few with joy ,
A blest and bold desertor fly,
ῡι. Possest of what t'ne great despise,
In real, richer pomp Ι rise,
Than if, from fair Apulia's plain,
. Istor'd in heaps the various grain,
While of the wealthy mass secure,
Amidst the rich abundance poor.
The streamlet, flowing through my ground ;
Ἴ The wood, which a few actes bound;
's The little sarm of kindly⁴ ΙόἰῙ,
Nor saithless to its master' s teil,
‘shall tell the consul, whose domuin
Extende o'er Africa's ferme plain,
. Though os his envied lot possem,
He ne'er shall be like Horace blest.
⁷³0· Though not-*thefam'd Calabriam bee
Collect its golden sweets for me:
For me no Fon-mian vintage grows,
With mellow'd warmth where Bacchus flows ῑ
Νοι· 011 the verdant Gallie mead
My floeks of richer fleeces seed:
Yet am 1 not with want opprest‚
Which vainly seeks the porr of rest,
Nor would thy bounteous 'nand deny
F My larger wishes to supply ·
«But while thos e wishes I rest rain,
α Fal-ther 1 sttetc'n my small domain
Than could Ι distant kingdomsjoin‚
And make united empires mine ε
For sure the sate of man is such,
xThey greatly want, who eovet much:
..Tffin happy he, whom heaven has fed
'‘J-with fruge] but sufficient bread.
