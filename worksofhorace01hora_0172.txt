153 THE womzs oF nomon„

There‘shall th' abundant incense flame,
And thou transported quaff the rising steam ς
There shall the power of music jein,

And raise the song with harmony divine;
There shall the youths and virgins pay
To thee their grateful offerings twice a-day.
Like Sanan priests the dance shall lead,
And many a mazy measure round thee tread.

For me , alas ! those jo ys are o'er‚
For me the ver-nal garland blooms no mone ς
No more the feats of wine I prove,
Nor the delusive hopes of muta] love.
Yet why, ah! sair-one, still too dear,
Steals down my cheek the involuntary tear ἶ
Or why thus salter o'er my tongue

The words, which once harmonicus pour'd along ³

Swift through the fields, and flowing streams
ἶ follfow thee·1nv1s10nary dreams,

Now, now I seize, Ι clasp thy eharms,
³„nd now you bnrst ah cruel. ¹ from my arms*
