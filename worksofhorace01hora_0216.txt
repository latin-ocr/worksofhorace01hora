ODE XV.
’ ΤΟ NEAERA.

CLEAR was the night, the face ofheaven serene·v
Bright shone the moon amidst her starry train,
then round my neck as curls the rendril-vine—
(Loose are ‘its curlings, if eompar'd· to thine ;)
’'I'was then, insulting every heavenly power,
That, as I dictated, you boldly swore z
While the gaunt wolfpursues the trembling sheep ς
While fierce Orion harrows up the deep ς
While Phoebus’ looks float wanton in the wind,
¹ Thus shall Neaera prove, thus ever kind.

But, if with aught of man was Horace born,
Severely shalt thou feel his honest scorn ;

Nor will he tamely bear the bold delight,

With which his rival riots out the night,

But in his anger seek some kinder dame,

XVarm with the raptures of a mutual fiame3

Nor shall thy tage, thy grief, or angry charms.
Reoall the lover to thy faithless arms.

And thou, whoe'er thou art, who joy to shine,
Proud as thou art, in spoils which once were mine..
Though wide thy land extends, and large thy sold,
Though rivers roll for thee their purest gold,
*Though nature's wisdom in her works were thine,
And beauties of the human face divine,

Yet soon thy pride her wandering love shall mourn.
'While 1 shall laugh, exulting in my turn„
