176 THE WORKS OF HORACE„

ODE Xm.

TO LYCE:

THE gods, the gods have heard my praym⁸
See, Lyce, see 'that hoary hair,
Yet you atoast would shine ;
You impudently drink and joke,
And with a broken voice provoke
Desires no longer thine.

Cupid, who joys in dimple sleek,
Now lies in blooming Chia's cheek,

Who tunes the melting lay ;
From blasted oaks the wauton flios,

Scar'djatzthy wrinkles, haggard eyes,
And head snow'd o’er with gray.

Nor glowing purple, nor the blaze
Of jewels70an restore the days,

To thee those days of glory,
Which, wasted on the wings of time,
Even from thy birth to beauty's prime,

Recorded stand in story.

Ah ! whither is thy Venus fled 2

That bloom by nature⁷s cunning spread 2
That every graceful art <1

Of her, of her, what now remains,

Who breath'd the loves, who charm'd the swains,
And snatch’d me from my beart? ’
