130 THE WORKS OF HORACE-

There doom'd to fill, unceasing task !
With idle mil, an ever-streaming caelu
Impious‚ who in the hour of rest

- Could plunge their daggers in a husband⁷s breast.

Yet w01 thy of the nuptia! flame,

And nobly meriting a deathless name,
Of many, one untainted maid,

Gloriously false, her perjur 'd sire betray⁷d.
Thus to her youthful lord--Arise ;

AwaRe, lest sleep eterna} close thine eyes ς
Eternal sleep : and ah! from whom

You little dreaded the relentless doom.
Oh! fly, my lord, this wrathful sire:

Far from my sisters fly, those sisters dire,
Who riot in their husbands’ blood,

As lionesses rend their panting food :
While I, to such fell deed a foe,

Nor bind thee here, nor strike the fatal blow.
Melet my father load withchains,

Or banish to N umidia⁷s farthest vlains :
My crime, that I, a loyal wife,

{n mercy spar'd a wretched husband’s life.
‘while Venus, apd the shades of night

Protect thee, speed, by sea or land, thy ssight. ;
May every happy omen wait

To guide thee through this gloomy hour of Fare Ξ
Yet not sorgetsul of my doom, ’

Engrave thygrateful sorrows on nJy tomb.
