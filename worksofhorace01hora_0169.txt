To· day at least hath been my own
For 1 have clearly liv' d to· day:
Then let toemorrow’ s clouds arise,

¹ Or puter suns o'erspread the cheerful skie&

Not Jove himself can now make void
The j05‚ that wing’d the flying bour ;
The certain blessing once enjoy'd,
Is safe beyond the godhead s power;
Nought can recall the acted scene,

What hath been, spite of Jove himself, hauh beer..

But Fortune, ever-changing dame,
Indulges her malicious joy,
And constant plays her haughty game,
Proud of her office to destroy;
To-day to me her bouuty flows,
And now to others she the bliss bestow·s-.

1 can applaud her while she stays;

But if she shake her rapid winge,
I can resign with careless ease

The richest gifts her favour brings,
Then folded lie in virtue's arms,
And honest poverty's undower²d charms.

Though the mast howl beneath the wind-V.
1 make no mercenary prayers‚
Nor with the gods a bargain bind
With future vows, and streaming tearsv
To save my wealth from adding more
To boundless ocean's avarieious stote :

Then in my little barge 1⁷11 ride,
Secure amid the foamy wave,

Calm will 1 stem the threatning tide,
And fearless all its tumults braveg
