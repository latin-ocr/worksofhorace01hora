196 THE WORKS OF HORACE

0151: X.
To MAEans=

WHEN filthy Maevius hoists the spreading sai]
Each luckless omen shall prevail.

Ye southern winds, invert rthe foamy tides,
And hang his labouring vessel⁷s sides ;

Let Eurus rouse the main with blackening roms.
Crack every cable, every oar ;

Let the north wind rise dreadful o'er the floodsf
As when it breaks the mountain-woods,

Nor let one friendly star shine o'er the night,
When sets Orion's gloomy light.

Mayst thou no kinder winds, Ο Maevius, meet,
Than the victorious Grecian fleet,

W'hen Pallas turn'd her rage from ruin'd Troy,
The impious Ajax to destroy.

With streams of sweat the toiling sailor gicws‘.
Thy sace a muddy paleness shows;

Nor shall thy vile, unmanly wailings move
The pity of avenging Jove.

While watery winds the bellowing oeean shake?
I see thy luckless vessel break :

But if thy earcass reach the winding shore,
And birds the pamper'd prey demur,

A lamb and lustful goat shall thank the storm„
And I the sacrifice perform '
