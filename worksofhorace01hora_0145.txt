ODE XIV.

ΟΝ THE RETURN OF AUGUSTUS FROM
SPAIN.

[Ἴ ΤΗῩ prime, Ο Rome, who foreign realms
Explor' d like Jove' s immortal s‚on
Fearless to search the laus-3²1 w1 eath
By death and glorious daring won,
; Victorious comes from farthest Spain
‘ro Romerand all his guardian gods again.

’ Let her, who to her arms ‚receives
2· Withjoy her own, her lam-'el d spous e

Her private sacrifice pe rfor’m d,
5.- Pay to just Hcaven heu· public vows‚
'2³ And let the fair Octavia lead
The matron-train in suppliant veils array’d ;

The matron-train, to whose}¹ glad arms
· Their sons, with conquest crown'd, return;
And you fair youth, whose pious tears
Your slaughter' d sires and husbands mouru-
, This day at least your griefs restrain,
{nd luckless from ill· -omen d words abstain

This day, with truly fes talioy,
Shall drive all gloomy cares away ;
For, while imperial Caesar holds
. O’er the glad Earth his awful sway‚
“ Nor sear of death from foreign arms,
(ξς civil tage, my dauntless sou] alarms.
