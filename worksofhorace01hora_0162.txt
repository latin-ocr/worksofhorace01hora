ODE XXV.

ΤΟ BACCHUS.

WHITHER, in sacred eostasy,
Bacchus, when fullos thy divinity,
Dost thou transport me ’ἔ To what glades ’ἒ
'What gloomy caverns, unfrequented shades?
Iu what recesses shall I raise
My voice to sacred Caesar’s deathless praise,
Amid the stare to bid him shine,
Rank'd in the oouncils os the powers divine ’ἒ
Some holder song shall wake the lyre,
And sounds unknown its trembling strings inspira
Thus o’er the steepy mountain's height,

Starting from sleep, thy priestess takes her ssight.; -

Amaz'd beholds the Thracian snows,

With languid streams where icy Heber flows,
Or Rhodope’s high-towering head,

where frantie bhoirs barbarian measures tread.
O'er pathless rocks, through lonely groves7

With what delight my raptur²d spirit roves!
othon, who rul'stthe Naiad's breast2

By whom the Bacchanalian maids, possesst
&Vitldsacred rage inspir'd by thee,

Tem· stom the bursting glebe th' uprooted trec„
Nothing or low, or mean, I sing,

No mortal sound shall shake the swelling string. · ,

The venturous theme my soul alarms,

But warm'd by thee the thought of danger chartus·  

XVhen vine-crown'd Bacchus leads the way,
What can his daring votaries dismay?
