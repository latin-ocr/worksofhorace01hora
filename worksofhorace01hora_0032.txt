24 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

The quiet of his rural seat ;
Yet, want untutor’d to sustain,
Soon rigs his shatter’d bark again.

No mean delights possess his soul,
With good old wine who crowns his bow] 3
&Vhose early revels are begun
Ere half the course os day be run,
Now, by some sacred fountain laid,
Now, stretch’d beneath some boweri'ng shade.

The tented camps a soldier charm,
Trumpets and fifes his bosom warm ς
Their mingled sounds with joy he'll hear,
These sounds of war which mothers sear.
The sportsman‚ chill’d by midnight J ove,
Forgets his tender, wedded love,
W'hether his faithful hounds pursue,
And hold the bounding hind in view ⁵,
KVhether the bear his hunters soils,

A nd foaming breaks the spreading tons,

An ivy-wreath‚ fair Learning's prize,
Raises Maeeenas to the skies,

The breezy grove, the mazy round,

‘Where the light Nymphs and Satyrs bound„
Π there the sacred Nine inspire

The breathing flate, and strike the lyre, ,
There let me fix my last retreat,

Far from the little vulgar, and the great.
But if you rank me with the choir,

Who tun'd with art the Grecian lyre,

Swift to the noblest heights os fame

{hall ri'se thy poet’s d'eathless name.
