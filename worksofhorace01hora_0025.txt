the fortune which he had the honour of receiving
stom his illustrious patron. Among the numerous
authors os antiquity, others, perhaps, may be more
admired, or esteemed; none more amiable, more

The difficulty ostranslating this part os his works

his dialognes ; from his not marking his transitione
from thought to thought, but giving them as they

are of great lise and spirit ; nor should attanslator
be too coldly regular in supplying the connection,

altering the mensures of our author for the sake of
a more musical oadence ; so they, who have irni-

numbers is a peculiar part os his character, which
ought to be preserved almost as faithfully as his
sentiments.

a master's hand. But the missortnne of our trans²
lator-s is, that they have only one style; and con·²
