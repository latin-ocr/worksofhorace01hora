GOLD hath no lustr-e of its own,

lt shines by temperate use alone,
And when in earth it boarded lies,
My Sallust can the mass despise.

With never-falling wing shall Fame

'To-latest ages bear the name

Os Proculeius, who could prove

Α father, in a brother’s love.

By virtue’s precepts to controul
The. furious passinus of the sou}

Is over wider realms to reign,
Unenvied Monarch‚ than if Spain
You could to distant Lybia juin,

And both the Carthages were thine.

The Dropsy, by indulgence nurs’d,

Pursues us with increasing thirst,
Tin art expells the cause, and drains
The water-ylangour from our veinS.
But virtue can the crowd unteach
Their false, mistaken forms of speech 'c
Virtue, to crowds a foe profest,
Disdains to number with the blest
Phraates, by his slaves ador'd,

And to the Parthian crown restor’d,
And gives the diadem, the throne,
And laurel wreath, to him alone

'Who can atreasur'd mass of gold
With firm, undazzled eye behold.
