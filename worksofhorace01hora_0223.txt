ODES, BOOK V.

Oris the lest-ear’d knot you tie,

Yet death your vain attempts shall fly .

Then on your shoulders will 1 ride,

And earth shall shake beneath my pride,
Could 1 with life arrimage warm

(Impertinent‚ you saw the chaum)

Or tear down Luna from her skies,

Or bid the dead, though burn'd, arise,

,Or mix the draught inspiring love,

And shall my art on thee suceessless prove ³
