:38 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

ODE ΧῙ.
ΤΟ LEUCON OE.

STRIVE not, Leuconoe„ to pry
Into the secret will of fate,

Nor impious magio vainly try⁷
To know our lives' uncertain date ;

VVhether th' indulgent power divine
Hath many seasons yet in stom,
01- this the latest winter thine.
Which breaks its waves against the shore.

Thy life‘with wiser arts be crown'd,
Thy filter⁷d wines abundant pour; ¹
The lengthen²d hope with prudence bound
Proportion'd to the flying hour:

· Even while we talk in careless ease,
Our envious minutes wing their flight ;

'Fhen swist the fleeting pleasure seim,
Nor trust to-morrow's doubtful light.
